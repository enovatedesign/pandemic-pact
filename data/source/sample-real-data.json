    "Abstract": "Up to 1 in 5 patients hospitalised by COVID-19 have evidence of heart muscle injury as measured from a blood test. This is associated with a high death rate. Using an MRI scan of the heart we aim to investigate how often, and in what way, the heart becomes damaged, and how the heart recovers 6 months later. We need to know how heart muscle damage and recovery is affected by age, sex, ethnicity and other medical conditions (such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and narrowing of blood vessels), as these are also known to be associated with high death rates. We also want to see if we can improve the diagnosis of viral heart damage from a simple ECG, which may save patients having invasive heart tests which can be uncomfortable, are expensive and carry a small risk of serious complications and may put healthcare staff at increased risk of exposure to COVID-19.",

The specific content of the messages will be a combination of public health advice and targeted, salient and culturally appropriate messages. We will evaluate the efficacy of our interventions.\n\nWe will disseminate, share information and experience gained in a rapid and timely\nmanner to support the behavioural change to mitigate the risk of infection by engaging\nwith stakeholders, community leaders, policy makers, including NHS England and PHE.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "216,392",
    "Abstract": "Aerosol generation occurs when tiny droplets of liquid are suspended in the air. Aerosols can be generated during many medical procedures. Some procedures might produce more aerosols than others, and droplets of different sizes, but there is a lot of uncertainty about this at the moment. What is known is that aerosols can carry viruses, like coronavirus, which risks further infections if inhaled by healthcare staff or other patients. Due to this potential risk, many operations have been delayed or are being performed with extra equipment, greatly reducing the ability of the NHS to resume important services. The AERATOR study aims to rapidly study the amount and type of aerosol generated when medical procedures are performed, and how infectious this aerosol is. This will be performed using specialist equipment in operating theatres and wards to measure real-life aerosol generation. By using specialist equipment, only available at Bristol University, we can also investigate how long coronavirus survives in clinical environments. This vital information will show how best to organise operating theatres, medical procedures, out-patient clinics, wards and use of protective equipment, in order to protect patients and staff while maximising the ability of the NHS to resume life-saving work.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "793,644",
    "Abstract": "A critical gap in knowledge is our understanding of immune correlates of protection from COVID-19, and the fine specificity of protective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. This gap is a huge impediment to an entire spectrum of major health care issues, ranging from return to work policies for NHS staff and recovered patients to guiding therapeutic interventions, vaccine development and clinical trials. The WHO cautions that simple antibody tests do not correlate with immunity. In fact robust responses correlate with disease severity, while lower titre responses are associated with accelerated viral clearance (Tan et al, medRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042382). It is essential to have more specific, qualitative humoral assays and Immunoglobulin (Ig) tests that clearly identify protective immunity, and distinguish from deleterious responses to be avoided by vaccination. We will characterise the; fine-specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antigen (i.e. S, RBD, N) specific Ig, cross-reactivity (i.e. of anti-S2) to other circulating human Coronaviruses (HCoV), correlation of Ig Fc-binding glycosylation patterns with Fc-gamma receptors used, with Immunoglobulin effector functions such as Neutralisation, Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) and Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The powerful combination of diagnostic, high throughput MS and comprehensive functional analysis will be applied to 3 clinical cohorts; 1) severe COVID-19 (progressors), 2) survivors(moderate) and 3) mild or asymptomatic cases. This study has already been initiated with the aim of; quickly providing essential data for critical clinical decisions for management of NHS staff, while providing standardised tests for intervention therapies, vaccine development and immune benchmarks for clinical trials.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "13,984,021",
    "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated the development of a large number of potential COVID-19 vaccines (1, 2) and it is likely that at least two of these will be licensed and available during 2020/2021. Most vaccines in development are expected to be licensed as a two dose, homologous prime/boost schedule. Given the anticipated programmatic challenges of immunising large proportions of the population, there would be advantages to having flexible immunisation programmes where the second dose is not necessarily the same as the first dose, i.e. a permissive approach to using heterologous prime/boost schedules. Accordingly this study will determine the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of heterologous prime/boost schedules for candidate COVID-19 vaccines that are potentially to be deployed in the UK. The vaccines to be studied in this protocol will primarily be determined by those made available to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) for population use. This will be an adaptive platform study, so as further vaccines get their licensure in the UK, they can be added to the trial, increasing the number of prime-boost vaccine permutations. The population to be studied will be adults over the age of 50 years; including those with comorbidities classified as mild/moderate/well controlled, as immunisation will most likely be prioritised for an older adult population with co-morbidities.Recruitment of individuals identifying as being of black and minority ethnicity will be prioritised. The sample size will be 460 participants, consisting of 4 group of 115. Vaccines will be given at 28 day intervals. All participants will have bloods tests at day 0, 28, 56, 112 and 365, and participants in the immunology sub-group (N=100, 25 per group) will have additional blood samples taken at day 7, 14, 35 and 42. The primary endpoint will be anti-SARS-CoV2 spike IgG at day 56 (1 month after the booster dose). This is a non-inferiority study, with the non-inferiority margin being a 0.63 fold-difference between the anti-SARS-CoV2 spike IgG geometric mean concentration in the heterologous boost arm and that in the homologous boost arm. The standard deviation of GMC on log scale (base 10) is 0.4 based on the current available data (1). Allowing for 25% of participants withdrawing or being sero-positive at baseline the sample size of 460 achieves 90% of power at one-sided 1% significance level.",

    "GrantTitleEng": "Estimating the long-term health impacts of changes in alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic",
    "GrantAmountConverted": "70,468",
    "Abstract": "Research question What is the potential longer-term indirect effect of COVID-19 on alcohol harm in England? Background Between one-fifth and one-third of adults are drinking more than before the pandemic, with a similar proportion drinking less. There is some evidence that heavier drinkers pre-COVID-19 have increased their consumption the most. Healthcare utilisation has reduced during COVID-19, bringing a risk that alcohol harm could worsen but become less visible. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has warned addiction services could be overwhelmed by post-pandemic demand. Alcohol harm includes morbidity and mortality, healthcare costs, and wider social consequences. The longer-term indirect effect of COVID-19 on alcohol use and harm is unknown. Our research fills this gap using microsimulation models, considering several scenarios, accounting for ongoing uncertainty in COVID-19 restrictions and drinking patterns. Aims and objectives Aims: 1) estimate future health, social and economic impacts of changes in alcohol consumption observed during COVID-19; 2) mitigate future alcohol harm by developing and disseminating recommendations to policymakers and stakeholders. Objectives: Simulate the future impact of recent changes in alcohol consumption on alcohol harm for the following alcohol consumption scenarios (2020 to 2035): Baseline: pre-2020 trends continue Short-term: trends between March 2020 and the most up-to-date data available are used, before reverting to baseline Medium-term: current trends remain for two years, before reverting to baseline Permanent impact: current trends continue Estimate the impact on alcohol-related morbidity and mortality, hospitalisations, harm and costs by age-group, sex and socio-economic status (SES), to gauge indirect effects of COVID-19 on alcohol-related inequalities Develop and disseminate recommendations to influence policy and minimise future alcohol harm. Methods We will adapt our validated microsimulation model with relevant data: 1) Population module (ONS population estimates); 2) Risk factor module (alcohol sales/Alcohol Toolkit Study); 3) Disease epidemiology module (incidence/prevalence, hospitalisations, mortality and survival for various alcohol-related conditions); 4) Health economic/indirect impacts module (annual costs per case; risk of wider alcohol harm e.g. suicide/domestic violence); 5) Intervention module. Model outputs include age-, sex- and SES-disaggregated estimates of: annual premature mortality, alcohol-related disease incidence, alcohol-related hospitalisations and healthcare costs. Timelines Months 1-2 involve consultation with patient and public involvement (PPI) representatives, refinement/testing of scenarios, collating and inputting data. Months 2-5 include modelling, analysis and writing up, with preliminary results and recommendations consulted on at a PPI workshop in month 4. Results will be disseminated in month 6. Anticipated impact and dissemination Policy recommendations are likely to highlight alcohol-related healthcare needs, and population-level policy solutions e.g. pricing, marketing and availability. Alcohol is a cross-cutting issue, and we will use existing networks of Institute of Alcohol Studies and PHE to disseminate results to parliamentarians and policy officials, and to contribute to upcoming government consultations. We will hold a symposium for policymakers, and release a summary briefing with policy recommendations, with input from PHE and PPI representatives. An IAS report will be distributed to the media, featured in the Alcohol Alert newsletter, and on social media. A peer-reviewed journal article will also be submitted.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "7,551,382",
    "Abstract": "Although the risk to pregnant women following COVID-19 infection is generally low, there is a 2-3 fold increased risk of preterm birth for women with symptomatic COVID-19 and recent analysis of a large registry indicates that pregnant women are more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit with COVID-19 than age-matched non-pregnant women. The current JCVI advice is that COVID-19 vaccines should be offered to pregnant women at the same time as the rest of the population, based on their age and clinical risk group. However, as pregnant women were specifically excluded from trials of COVID-19 vaccines, there are important and unanswered questions regarding the safety, immunogenicity and persistence of immunity in the vaccinated pregnant woman and her infant, as well as the optimal vaccination schedule to be used in this population. Using an &quot;adaptive&quot; platform design Preg-CoV will address these questions for current vaccines, as well as for new vaccines as they are approved. The primary objective of Preg-CoV is to determine whether the immune response at delivery (anti-S protein IgG concentrations) following immunisation with COVID-19 vaccines at &ldquo;long&rdquo; dosing intervals is superior to that following immunisation at &ldquo;short&rdquo; dosing intervals. Preg-CoV is designed as a single-blind, randomised, phase II multi-centre study. Eligible participants will be healthy pregnant women &ge;18 years of age, between 13 and 34 weeks gestation on the day of planned vaccination, with an uncomplicated, singleton pregnancy, no known increased risk for complications of pregnancy and no contraindication to the vaccines in the study. Women will be randomised to receive 2 doses of vaccines at either short (4-6 weeks) or long intervals (8-12 weeks). In the 28 to 34 week cohort, the 2nd dose will be provided after delivery, allowing the impact of one dose in pregnancy to be assessed. In the main (13-24 week) cohort, participants will receive a routine pertussis-containing vaccine at one of the visits; this will facilitate blinding of the schedule. A separate cohort will establish the response to a single dose in those who received one dose before pregnancy. All participants will have blood tests performed at baseline and 2-4 weeks post first and second doses, at delivery and at 12 months. Infants will have blood tests at day 0 (cord) and one further sample at either 6 or 12 weeks (via randomisation) to assess antibody kinetics. Breast milk samples will be obtained in a sub-group. The main immune outcomes will be the anti-Spike and anti-nucleocapsid immunoglobulins, neutralising antibodies, cellular immune responses, IgA and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk (in a subgroup). Reactogenicity will be assessed through use of an electronic diary for 7 days post vaccination and a range of safety outcomes will be collected including pregnancy, including neonatal outcomes of special interest and infant development at 12 months. 200 participants will be recruited per vaccine included in the main cohort (100 in each arm). By collecting these data in a systematic and controlled manner we aim to inform evidence-based guidance for optimal vaccination of pregnant women.",

    "Abstract": "End-of-Life-Care (EOLC) improves health-related quality of life and life-expectancy (1), despite this one in four UK families miss out on crucial support particularly those from Ethnic Minorities groups (2&ndash;5). Research into EOLC for Ethnic Minorities is out-dated, out-with the UK, or from London, where Ethnic Minorities make up over 40% of the population (5&ndash;9). We know nothing of EOLC experiences of Ethnic Minorities in areas of the UK where they are more disparate, despite national research calls for such information (5). Key research policy priorities are to promote equity in EOLC, specifically to rectify &quot;poor outcomes amongst Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) populations&quot; (8&ndash;12). BAME groups are heterogeneous. Older Black people are a crucial tracer population for achieving patient-preferred outcomes, and they experience some of the highest levels of material disadvantage (5,10&ndash;12). During the COVID-19 pandemic, deaths amongst Black populations have been twice as high as in White populations of similar socioeconomic status (13). Despite this Black people are still less likely to access end-of-life services (10,14&ndash;17), which play a crucial role in improving care (18). It is unclear why this is and how service changes have exacerbated this. Aims and objectives To identify family priorities for EOLC development, to meet the needs of Black people during and after the COVID&mdash;19 pandemic. We will explore family and patient (by proxy) views on; experiences of EOLC (positive/negative), barriers to EOLC and how EOLC could better meet Black people s needs. Methods We will conduct a qualitative study using in-depth semi-structured interviews. Bereaved relatives of decedents (>50 years) who identified as being Black African, Black Caribbean or Black other (13) and who died during the COVID-19 pandemic will be recruited/purposively sampled through community groups, social media and targeted online advertising (23). The sample will be balanced by relationship, gender-identity, age and decedent s illness (COVID-19/cancer/non-cancer). Previous experience suggests no more than 60 interviews will be required to ensure data sufficiency. Interviews will be conducted following COVID-19 guidelines. The topic guide, developed with PPI partners and drawing on VOICES survey domains (19), will allow participants to share their experiences. Prompts will elicit information about needs (met/unmet), experiences/views, support structures and barriers to care. We will use a modified theoretical framework of access and critical race theory which consider service availability, accommodation, affordability, acceptability and awareness (20&ndash;23). Policy engagement, dissemination and impact Our research will support policymakers to accommodate recent changes in service, whilst addressing structural, cultural and behavioural challenges to equitable EOLC. The team will undertake targeted dissemination of emerging findings, including 10-minute COVID-19 webinars and existing monthly Department of Health and Social Care/Policy Research Unit meetings from March 2021 until November 2021. We will also present findings to the National Clinical Director for End-of-Life and the National End-of-Life Care Intelligence Network. We will deliver three main outputs: A formal report and briefing of findings, following a 1/3/25 page format, for policy makers (November 2021), an article in peer-reviewed journal (December 2021); and public-facing report developed for bereaved relatives/carers (November 2021).",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "128,470",
    "Abstract": "In the face of rapidly emerging viral pandemics, the normal commercial approach to antiviral translational research will not produce therapeutics in a timely manner. Consequently, there is an urgent need to prepare a strategic resource, openly available, to stimulate research into new antivirals for emerging viruses and, in an emergency situation, to provide compounds for expedited preclinical and human testing. Identification of collections of potent inhibitors of essential viral mechanisms within a virus family provides an excellent starting point for this accelerated transition to preclinical toxicity studies. Ultimately, we envisage libraries of ?poised? anti-coronavirus compounds would enable future responses to emerging pandemics as well as targeting SARS-CoV-2. We believe high throughput screening of a well-curated library enables this, with a focus on identification of robust chemical templates suitable for optimisation. We propose an HTS to identify non-nucleoside small molecules (mwt 200-450 Da) that inhibit the nsp12, the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Dependent upon the activity of our molecules, we will test our compounds against other coronavirus replicon systems or infectious virus. The coronavirus polymerase is a druggable antiviral target, conserved across the viral family. SARS-CoV RdRp and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp share a remarkable 96% identity. Morse et al (2020) comment that ?efforts towards drugging coronavirus in a RdRp manner should provide a basis not only to develop therapeutics for 2019-nCoV, but could provide broad-spectrum antivirals useful for future CoV outbreaks?. To that end we expect that classes of inhibitors identified by this proposal will have application across the coronavirus family.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "380,653",
    "Abstract": "This award is being made in recognition that key Research Unit staff have been redeployed from their usual work, and Research Unit resources utilised, to contribute to the first phase of a rapid research response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The current coronavirus pandemic is a novel challenge for healthcare systems worldwide. The virus is currently spreading at alarming rates in Asia, Europe and North America, and it is essential that African countries prepare for the arrival and local transmission of SARSCoV- 2 and develop effective response mechanism. The African MRC Units have a critical role to play in researching the epidemic but also in supporting local health systems in this response. In Uganda, diagnostic capacity is to our knowledge currently limited to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI, Entebbe) and Central Public Health Laboratories (CPHL, Kampala). Given the rapid spread of the virus globally, there is a high risk the first positive cases will be detected in Uganda over the next few weeks. Lessons learnt from other countries suggest that the ability to rapidly diagnose SARS-CoV-2 positive samples is critical in controlling the pandemic. However, given the pace of virus spread seen in Asia, Europe and the US, the local diagnostic capacity will need to be increased substantially to handle the anticipated increase in suspected cases. The Unit has well-trained laboratory staff, robust procedures and excellent facilities which could support the national effort to prevent and contain an outbreak in Uganda. Support Capacity: The Unit intends to prepare for supporting the national diagnostic capacity by offering up to 2,500 tests per month over the next 4 months. Full virus genome sequences would be generated from a subset of positive samples, the resulting data would support the international effort in understanding the regional movement of the virus and would monitor for virus changes that might influence diagnostics or the pathology of the virus.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "498,974",
    "Abstract": "Research question What can we learn from international evidence and experiences in order to support the recovery of the social care sector and to inform the development of policies to prevent and manage future outbreaks in social care settings in England? Background The first wave of Covid-19 has had an enormous impact on people who use and provide long-term care in England, with substantial excess mortality, compared to previous years, both for people who use home care and who live in care homes, and other impacts on mental and physical health, it has also had a major impact financial impact on care providers. As England faces a second wave and considers the recovery of the sector, there is an opportunity to learn more in-depth from relevant experiences of other countries in implementing measures to prevent and mitigate these impacts in care settings and through taking a systematic and rigorous approach to synthesizing emerging scientific evidence about which measures have worked well or not. Aims and objectives We aim to facilitate learning from the scientific evidence and relevant experiences of other countries in preventing and mitigating Covid, as well as recovering from its impacts in social care setting through: Co-development of a framework to provide strategic direction for how the social care sector in England can recover from, and respond to, Covid-19 (we define the social care sector as care provided in residential and community settings, by paid and unpaid carers) Synthesis of international evidence and lessons learnt that are relevant to the English social care sector Informing the development of policies and practices to support recovery and better prevent and manage future outbreaks Methods We will use situational analysis and Theory of Change (ToC) to establish a framework from which to assess the relevance of international experiences and evidence to the social care system in England. We will then carry out scoping reviews to map and synthesise empirical evidence on measures that can support the social care sector in preventing and mitigating the negative impact of Covid. We will then use a case study approach, including document analysis and interviews, to review in detail the experiences and learnings from 4 countries. Finally, we will apply the framework developed through ToC to synthesise findings from these work streams. Timelines for delivery The project plans to start on the 1st of November and will last for 18 months. The work plan has been organized to deliver outputs in a timely manner as practicable, recognising the critical nature of the Covid pandemic. Anticipated impact and dissemination The project s framework and priorities will be co-developed with stakeholders, to ensure that the research is relevant and useful within an English social care context. The team is well positioned to ensure effective and timely dissemination through their own policy and practice networks, their institutions, relationships with media and the dissemination platforms provided by their respective institutions and the LTCcovid.org website.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "181,764",
    "Abstract": "Background: COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on care homes, their residents and families, and staff. Over 20,000 care home residents in England have died from COVID-19 to date. Many more have experienced symptoms and distress. Palliative care is an essential component of the pandemic response. However, there has been limited examination of palliative and end-of-life care provision in English care homes during COVID-19, or strategies to improve this during subsequent pandemic peaks. Aim: To examine the response of care homes in England to meet the rapidly increasing need for palliative and end-of-life care for residents during the COVID-19 pandemic, and make recommendations for policy. Objectives: 1. To describe the response of care homes to palliative and end of life care needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the experiences, preparedness and impact on the workforce. 2. To explore in-depth the challenges and facilitators to providing palliative and end of life care in care homes during the pandemic. 3. To make recommendations for policy and develop guidance that helps to improve and sustain palliative and end of life care during current and future pandemic peaks. Methods: Rapid, multicentre observational study, comprising two Work Packages (WPs): WP1. On-line rapid survey, to map care home provision of palliative and end-of-life care. 400 care homes in England will be identified through established networks (Wave 1), augmented with purposive sampling to capture care homes with and without onsite nursing provision, geographical, socio-economic and ethnic diversity, and areas most affected by COVID-19 (Wave 2). Structured data and free text will include care home characteristics; confirmed/suspected COVID-19 positive residents; use of guidance on symptom control, end-of-life care, comprehensive assessment, Advance Care Planning, anticipatory prescribing, communication; service innovations during COVID-19; integration with healthcare services; workforce wellbeing, retention; preparedness to provide palliative and end-of-life care; and facilitators and challenges to palliative care provision. The primary outcome will be preparedness to provide palliative and end-of-life care. Regression models will examine the factors independently associated with the outcome. WP2. In-depth case studies to explore challenges and facilitators to providing palliative and end-of-life care for residents during the pandemic. 20-24 care homes, purposively selected from WP1 based on the findings. On-line or telephone qualitative interviews with care home managers/clinical leads will be conducted. WP1 data will inform the questions and analysis, using qualitative directed content analysis. Data triangulation will synthesise WP1 and WP2 findings, focusing on the challenges and facilitators to providing palliative and end-of-life care in care homes, and development of policies to improve and sustain this. Timelines: This 12-month project will deliver reports in months 4 and 10, and a stakeholder workshop in month 11. Impact and dissemination: The research is designed for short- and medium-term policy impact, through care home, Patient and Public Involvement (PPI), and policy collaboration. An interim analysis will inform short-term policy during winter 2020/2021. Reports will be accompanied by PPI summaries, evidence summaries and guidance for front-line staff. Academic papers will be published as preprints to ensure timely dissemination.",

    "Abstract": "The University of Oxford and Vaccitech jointly developed and then exclusively out-licensed a serogroup E chimpanzee adenoviral vector vaccine encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to AstraZeneca. This vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, given as a single dose, has moved into Phase 2/3 studies in the UK, and in August 2020 begins Phase 3 studies in the US and Brazil. There are concerns that anti-vector immunity to the ChAdOx1 backbone may limit early boosting responses, or even boosts given on a yearly basis. Vaccitech has developed an alternative serogroup C chimeric gorilla adenoviral vector vaccine (ƒ??GAdVacƒ?), which has been shown in completed murine studies to elicit higher antibody and T cell immune responses than the ChAdOx1 candidates. Vaccitech is now developing the full-length spike glycoprotein encoding GAdVac candidate and will use this as both a stand-alone vaccine and evaluate the use of this candidate as a prime and a boost for the ChAdOx1 platform. Efficacy studies in ferrets will be pursued with Public Health England at Porton Down. The pre-master virus seed will be produced in the SOP- controlled Early Development Laboratories at Vaccitech in Oxford, and then transferred to Advent (Rome, Italy) for GMP manufacture. Advent has successfully made three GMP released lots of ChAdOx1 vectors for Vaccitech. Scientific advice will be sought from MHRA, and a formal GLP toxicology study will be performed due to the novelty of this vector. Within 12 months, the CTA to begin a Phase 1 immunogenicity study will be complete.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "49,952",
    "Abstract": "Creating a \"safe supply\" of drugs has the potential to reduce a variety of harms suffered by People Who Use Drugs (PWUDs), including non-fatal and fatal overdoses associated with Canada's ongoing opioid crisis. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and related social distancing measures, has complicated PWUDs ability to access the pharmacological substances they need, placing them at increased risk of harm from withdrawal and/or toxicity from unsafe 'street' sources of drugs. In the context of COVID-19, the college of pharmacists has lifted the requirement of triplicate prescriptions for controlled substances, making it easier for physicians and pharmacists to serve people in our public state of emergency. Addiction clinics have also developed more leniency for 'take-home' doses of medication (such as opioid agonist therapy) to encourage social isolation and support people in quarantine. However, access to a safe supply of opioids remains elusive for many PWUDs in Canada for reasons that are presently unclear. Integrating the expertise of PWUDs, clinicians, scientists, and legal scholars, the core aim of our project is to find ways to facilitate access to a safe supply of drugs in the context of the COVID-19. We will: 1) identify best practices for securing a safe supply for PWUDs, focused in part on how \"safe\" supply may be contextually conditioned; and 2) develop a set of recommendations and strategies to encourage the uptake of safe supply across Canada. These will take into account factors including the circumstances of PWUDs who have recently been released from prison and additional challenges related to geography, homelessness, poverty, race, and/or gender. Incorporating the lived experiences and expertise of PWUDs directly into our research, our team's combined medical, scientific, and legal training has the capacity to make sense of-and act upon-the evidence on how to provide access to a safe supply of drugs in the context COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "201,326",
    "Abstract": "Background While effective in limiting Covid-19 transmission, restrictions on family visits to care homes for older people can negatively impact residents emotional, cognitive and physical health and cause distress for families.1,2 Government has published guidance for care homes on establishing visiting policies that balance these risks, subject to local-area risk assessments from Public Health Directors.3 The guidance states, the first priority must remain preventing infections and visiting policy should still be restricted with alternatives sought wherever possible. However, it guides homes to develop a policy for limited visits which is made available and/or communicated to residents and families. This is challenging and potentially sensitive, with significant lobbying for increased access on compassionate and human rights grounds.4,5,6 Experience is evolving and care homes will manage these challenges differently.7,8,9,10 Research aims and objectives We will identify: range and diversity in care homes interpretation and implementation of guidance how scope for personalisation afforded by the guidance is reflected in policies need for, and use of, support (guidance, tools, assistance) to develop and implement policies perspectives on how policies are working; including feasibility, acceptability, equity and other impacts consultation with families and other stakeholders, including challenges, achievements and influence on policies how policies are communicated to residents, families and others; perspectives on how well this worked and why whether family members find policies understandable, fair and proportionate, and why how characteristics and circumstances of care homes, and contextual factors, influence all of the above The evidence generated by our study is intended to inform ongoing policy and practice during the current pandemic and be of relevance in the event of future epidemics and pandemics. Methods Stage one (months 1-6): To understand range and diversity and generate theory, we will administer a semi-structured questionnaire to care home managers or nominated senior staff (20 minutes; online or telephone) and review policy documents across 200 care homes, purposively-sampled. This provides sufficient breadth and depth and a sampling pool for later stages. Stage two (months 6-12): We will further develop explanatory analyses using twenty cases theoretically-sampled from the participating homes, involving 1-3 in-depth interviews with care home managers and nominated senior staff. Stage three (months 6-15): Thirty to thirty-five in-depth interviews with family carers, purposively-sampled to reflect diversity, will be conducted to explore understanding and views of care home policies. In all stages, data from will be thematically-analysed using NVivo; range and diversity will be fully described and patterns in the data identified and articulated.16,17,18 Findings will be refined and interpreted, and policy implications considered in consultation with our expert advisors and experts-by-experience. Supported by LSE and Care England s media and communications teams, we will monitor updates to Government guidance and key developments throughout to inform data-collection, analysis and interpretation. Three policy briefings and three peer-reviewed journal articles will be produced and promoted through our websites, professional networks, social media and public platforms. We will run joint webinars, give presentations and produce lay summaries.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "70,916",
    "Abstract": "This research addresses two questions: how effective are changes to information governance improving access to confidential patient data and/or personal data for medical research purposes, and should these changes be made permanent in the future. Robust science to inform pandemic control relies upon accessing individual patient data to improve understanding of the virus, the nature and severity of disease it causes, how it is spread, managed and treated, and the responses of individual patients to infection. At the start of the COVID-19 epidemic, the Secretary of State for Health issued a series of Notices under the Control of Patient Information Regulations 2002, suspending the need for consent to use confidential patient information. These Notices have been renewed, now expiring on March 31st 2021, and some bodies, including the Health Research Authority, have suggested that such changes may become permanent in future. There has been limited debate concerning the use of confidential data from individuals, and how suspending the need for consent to share confidential patient data might influence research, and public trust in research especially when associated with other GDPR provisions. This proposed research will evaluate the impact of these policies on the access of patient data for scientific research through desk-based legal and scientific analysis, interviews and a patient and participant focus group. As part of our analysis we will evaluate two key strands of law - confidentiality, upheld by UK common or case law, and data protection, through the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK Data Protection Act 2018. We will: review examples of COVID-19 scientific / clinical research and how they use confidential patient data, genetic/genomic data and/or personal data [methodology: desk-based review] analyse information governance changes adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including those relating to confidentiality and data protection [methodology: desk-based review] interrogate their impact on research type, size, power and speed through targeted interviews of researchers, regulators and patient advocates [6] evaluate these changes in the light of wider considerations, including patient trust and confidence through individual interviews [6]. The project will run over 7 months, commencing with legal and scientific analyses. These findings will be supplemented and informed by an external collaborator who will convene, run and report on a focus group comprising of members of the public and patients [end month 2]. Building on these elements, we will draft an accessible policy report clearly summarising findings and making specific recommendations for future policy development. An Expert Advisory Panel will be convened to provide external oversight of the study design and outputs [meetings month 1 and 6]. With the assistance of our in-house external affairs team to build targeted dissemination lists, the final report will be actively disseminated to policy makers, regulators and practitioners through our organisational and digital networks, and publicly accessible PHG Foundation website. In addition, a virtual launch event [month 7] will aim to raise visibility of the report, and guide future policy, including how these important issues are communicated to researchers, patients and wider publics.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "494,908",
    "Abstract": "Research question How has NHS support for patients post-hospitalisation for COVD19 been organised across the two waves of the pandemic and how can services be further developed to achieve holistic, integrated, equitable and cost-effective services? Background Understanding how to optimise NHS support for individuals post-COVID19 infection to maximise quality of life and deliver services which are cost-effective is critical to personalised, high quality, value for money care. In particular, patients whose infection initially required hospitalisation are likely to experience a greater proportion of burden from so-called long-COVID and therefore require more follow-up care and services. The Post-HOSPitalisation COVID19 (PHOSP-COVID) study aims to recruit 10,000 patients across all four nations of the United Kingdom (Tier 1) with more detailed data collected on 3,000 participants (Tier 2) including health service resource use, productivity and quality of life impacts at 3-6, and 12 months. The study was funded in July 2020 and has already recruited 1,000 patients to Tier 2 (admitted Feb ƒ?? Aug 2020) with their 3-6 month post-discharge visit completed by end Nov 2020. The study has received a six-month extension to enable recruitment of patients discharged in wave 2 from Dec 2020 until end March 2021. Aims and Objectives We will utilise the PHOSP-COVID platform to identify how patterns of care post-hospitalisation have evolved through the pandemic from the first wave (Mar-Jul 2020) through the second wave (Nov 2020 onwards). Using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods will enable us to identify the best performing health care pathways in terms of the extent to which they provide holistic, integrated, equitable and cost-effective care for patients discharged from hospital after COVID19 infection. Methods Activities are organised into five work packages: WP1) Surveys of the healthcare services provided to patients after hospital discharge at different NHS trusts for the first wave and second waves with classification into a typology of service delivery pathways. WP2) Qualitative interviews with patients, healthcare professionals, managers and commissioners with the aim to understand the different types of service that have been provided in different parts of the country. WP3) Analysis of the health-related quality of life that patients report at 3-6 months and 1 year after hospital discharge. Analysis of health service costs incurred and productivity changes of patients. WP4) Bringing the previous work package results together to inform the modelling of cost-effectiveness of different service delivery pathways, including consderations of equity of services provided in different parts of the country and to different types of patient. WP5) Dissemination to and engagement with stakeholders through regular meetings with patients, healthcare commissioners, providers such as NHS England, and relevant professional bodies. PPI representatives will be involved at every stage of the study and have been actively involved in this proposal. Timelines for delivery The bulk of the work will be completed within 12 months with and additional 3 months added as contingency and to allow for the final updating of the full one-year follow-up of PHOSP-COVID data collection for wave 2 of the pandemic.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "99331",
    "Abstract": "Background End-of-Life-Care (EOLC) improves health-related quality of life and life-expectancy (1), despite this one in four UK families miss out on crucial support particularly those from Ethnic Minorities groups (2?5). Research into EOLC for Ethnic Minorities is out-dated, out-with the UK, or from London, where Ethnic Minorities make up over 40% of the population (5?9). We know nothing of EOLC experiences of Ethnic Minorities in areas of the UK where they are more disparate, despite national research calls for such information (5). Key research policy priorities are to promote equity in EOLC, specifically to rectify \"poor outcomes amongst Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) populations\" (8?12). BAME groups are heterogeneous. Older Black people are a crucial tracer population for achieving patient-preferred outcomes, and they experience some of the highest levels of material disadvantage (5,10?12). During the COVID-19 pandemic, deaths amongst Black populations have been twice as high as in White populations of similar socioeconomic status (13). Despite this Black people are still less likely to access end-of-life services (10,14?17), which play a crucial role in improving care (18). It is unclear why this is and how service changes have exacerbated this. Aims and objectives To identify family priorities for EOLC development, to meet the needs of Black people during and after the COVID?19 pandemic. We will explore family and patient (by proxy) views on; experiences of EOLC (positive/negative), barriers to EOLC and how EOLC could better meet Black people s needs. Methods We will conduct a qualitative study using in-depth semi-structured interviews. Bereaved relatives of decedents (>50 years) who identified as being Black African, Black Caribbean or Black other (13) and who died during the COVID-19 pandemic will be recruited/purposively sampled through community groups, social media and targeted online advertising (23). The sample will be balanced by relationship, gender-identity, age and decedent s illness (COVID-19/cancer/non-cancer). Previous experience suggests no more than 60 interviews will be required to ensure data sufficiency. Interviews will be conducted following COVID-19 guidelines. The topic guide, developed with PPI partners and drawing on VOICES survey domains (19), will allow participants to share their experiences. Prompts will elicit information about needs (met/unmet), experiences/views, support structures and barriers to care. We will use a modified theoretical framework of access and critical race theory which consider service availability, accommodation, affordability, acceptability and awareness (20?23). Policy engagement, dissemination and impact Our research will support policymakers to accommodate recent changes in service, whilst addressing structural, cultural and behavioural challenges to equitable EOLC. The team will undertake targeted dissemination of emerging findings, including 10-minute COVID-19 webinars and existing monthly Department of Health and Social Care/Policy Research Unit meetings from March 2021 until November 2021. We will also present findings to the National Clinical Director for End-of-Life and the National End-of-Life Care Intelligence Network. We will deliver three main outputs: A formal report and briefing of findings, following a 1/3/25 page format, for policy makers (November 2021), an article in peer-reviewed journal (December 2021); and public-facing report developed for bereaved relatives/carers (November 2021).",

    "Abstract": "On 23 March, the UK went into lockdown in response to the Covid-19 threat. As a result, people's engagement with natural environments may have changed significantly which is likely to have had significant impact on their wellbeing. We will work with Natural England to understand changes in nature engagement and wellbeing in the UK before, during and after lockdown and help understand what Government and Statutory Bodies can do to ameliorate the impact of Covid-19 on wellbeing now and as part of the UK Government Green Recovery strategy from Covid-19. We will examine what lessons can be learned from this period of disruption for theory development and practice, and for the provision and management of natural places for human wellbeing by: 1) providing an in depth understanding of how wellbeing during and post lock-down has changed across the UK as a result of changes in access to- and engagement with different natural environments. 2) creating a mapping of different wellbeing outcomes associated with different types of natural environments and the use of these environments for different activities.  3) contributing to theory development through improving the measurement and examination of a key concept in nature-wellbeing studies \"a sense of being away\".  Four studies will be conducted analysing data on nature-engagement and wellbeing in: (1) a longitudinal survey study with a representative sample of (1500) UK households (June  2020-21) studying (changes in) wellbeing and engagement with different natural environments, (2) an analysis of social media images and comments posted during lockdown, (3) an ethnographic study with up to 30 families from different socio-demographic backgrounds to provide an in-depth insight into experiences during and post lockdown, and (4) secondary data analyses of data collected by Natural England over the last ten years to provide a broad perspective of nature engagement pre-, during and post lockdown.",

    "Abstract": "The novel strain of Coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused large numbers of deaths and severe societal disruption in China and is predicted to become a global pandemic. To prepare and respond we need to know how many people become infected, how many of them become ill, what their symptoms are, how many seek health care, how commonly they transmit to household contacts, what proportion need hospitalisation and what\nproportion die. We need to understand how the population responds e.g. hand washing, behaviours during and after coughing, sneezing or nose wiping, and whether people restrict their movements and social contacts. Since many of those infected will have relatively mild symptoms and not seek medical advice the only way to accurately obtain this information is to conduct large scale community studies. We will follow up members of\nthe public and contacts of cases using regular online surveys of symptoms and behaviours, secure tracking of participant movements, and testing for COVID-19 and other respiratory infections to build a detailed picture of how the virus spreads and the population responds. We will share this data with participants, health service and public health planners and the general public to help minimise the impact of the virus.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "49431",
    "Abstract": "Many dedicated staff and volunteers within the NHS ecosystem will experience Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as consequences of the covid-19 pandemic. Existing PTSD interventions which involve many sessions are not fit-for-purpose in light of the emergency and scale of the need. By combining a very innovative and effective psychotherapeutic method with biofeedback sensors, highly sensitive to user emotions, we will create a solution that can often cure PTSD within a single session. Within six months we will develop an accurate inexpensive bluetooth sensor, which users can use at home (on their finger or wrist). It will measure their stress/anxiety level and minute changes of their heart rhythm, analyse both in real time, and present feedback to the user through a friendly, appealing interface. Furthermore, it will enable therapists (working remotely from home) to view the user/client's emotional reactions in real-time and provide effective intervention. Mind-Heart-Tech can help users to improve their resilience and prevent relapse. Our initial focus will be to provide Mind-Heart-Tech and therapy to the dedicated NHS employees who have risked their lives to treat coronavirus patients. Later on it will be available to the wider UK population and subsequently internationally. Our sensors are very sensitive, monitor and calculate heart-rate changes better than i-watch, fitbit and similar sensors, and even tiny changes in stress levels from thoughts, imaginations and emotions. It will enable therapists to view their clients' emotion/anxiety level in real-time and treat them remotely, with options to add images and video that the user can watch. Both the therapist and the user can see and measure, immediately, how effectively the therapy is reducing the anxiety level of the user during the session and later on. As Mind-Heart-Tech provides objective measurements of the anxiety levels during the therapy, and gives feedback to both the therapist and the user during, between and after the therapy, it can improve any existing therapy method. It will also enable researchers and NHS to compare, immediately, how effective each method is, how fast the user recovers with each method, and which method has lowest relapse rates. The Mind-Heart-Tech together with new online therapies we will reduce the length of recovery of patients from several months to days.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "2352510",
    "Abstract": "Aim: The overall aim is to investigate the clinical and cost effectiveness of portable HEPA air filters in reducing symptomatic winter respiratory infections (including COVID-19) in residents of older people?s care homes. BACKGROUND To date SARS-CoV-2 infection has led to over one million deaths worldwide, with elderly care home residents disproportionately affected. There are currently 220,000 people over 65 years living in UK care homes, and this number is predicted to double by 2040. Respiratory infections (including SARS-CoV-2) are mainly spread when people breathe in or swallow airborne droplets containing germs. Care homes are obliged to follow DH&SC ?Code of Practice on the Prevention and Control of Infections?, but airborne transmission remains largely unmitigated. Portable high efficiency particulate (HEPA) air filtration units trap droplet and aerosolised bacteria and viruses, but research is urgently needed to help health and social care providers know whether portable HEPA filters are clinically and cost-effective in reducing symptomatic respiratory infections. OBJECTIVES Primary objective: To investigate the effect of portable HEPA air filters in private residential, communal and staff only rooms on residents? symptomatic winter respiratory infection episodes (including COVID-19) in care homes with air filters compared with residents in care homes without air filters. Secondary objectives: 1. To determine the effect of air filters installed in private residential, communal and staff only rooms during the winter months versus no air filters on residents?: a. Respiratory infections (symptomatic days) b. Fever and/or delirium and/or acute deterioration in physical ability (episodes and symptomatic days) c. Gastro-intestinal infection (episodes & symptomatic days) d. Antibiotic use (courses prescribed/days consumed) e. Number of falls/near falls f. Possible SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza-like illness infection episodes g. PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections h. PCR (or other test) confirmed Influenza A&B infections i. Other microbiologically confirmed infections including Streptococcal, Meningococcal, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Norovirus and Human Metapneumovirus infections j. GP diagnosed respiratory (including COVID), gastrointestinal, skin and urinary infections k. Perception of care home environment 2. To determine the effect of air filters versus no air filters installed during winter months on staff members?: a. Sickness days away from work b. Change over time in staff confidence in, and use of, infection prevention and control strategies. c. PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections d. PCR (or other test) confirmed Influenza A&B infections e. Other microbiologically confirmed infections including Streptococcal, Meningococcal, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Norovirus and Human Metapneumovirus infections f. Perception of care home environment 3. To determine the cost-effectiveness of air filter use in reducing symptomatic respiratory infection episodes(to include hospital admissions, deaths and cause of death). 4. To identify the views of care homes, local authority and CCG commissioners on intervention maintenance, sustainability and possible dissemination. 5. In the intervention arm: a. To explore staff, resident and residents? relatives' attitudes to and perceptions and experiences of air filters and determine factors influencing their use, including acceptability, satisfaction and potential benefits and harms. b. To assess the fidelity of the intervention. DESIGN A two-arm, 1:1 cluster randomisation controlled trial of portable HEPA air filters versus no air filters for reducing symptomatic winter respiratory infections (including COVID-19) in care home residents with mixed method process and economic evaluation. PROJECT TIMETABLE The funding start date for this trial is 01 July 2021 and the study duration is expected to be 42 months, to 31st December 2024. ANTICIPATED IMPACT AND DISSEMINATION Preventing infections could improve resident and staff quality of life, resident quantity of life, and the efficient use of health and social care resources, all expected to increase as the population ages. We will create a dissemination plan our collaborators and PPI, outputs to include: plain English summaries; publications/ presentations in high impact journals/ conferences; online webinars for care home managers, CCG and local authority commissioners.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "954936",
    "Abstract": "The clinical management of COVID-19 remains unclear. First, we do not know what the disease is yet; we are still learning a great deal about what it causes in humans. We do not know what treatments to give, what risk factors are present for severe disease, and how long people are sick. We are proposing a national observational study of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, with an embedded randomized clinical trial of an antiviral agent. The observational study will build on work that we have been doing for the past four years, with pre-established protocols and data collection infrastructure just for this purpose. The randomized clinical trial will be with global collaborators to make sure that Canadian patients inform the world, and vice versa, about how to best treat this new disease. Alongside this, we will conduct surveys of clinicians, researchers, and the public about how they understand this new outbreak, how they feel about participating in research during a major outbreak, and what should be done differently; all of which will inform our clinical studies. Finally, we have been asked by the WHO to conduct a formal guideline for the management of COVID-19, which we will perform as data begins to emerge from the clinical trials that are ongoing. All of these proposals, put together, create a suite of approaches to better understanding and managing a new infection. Our team is large and diverse, and has been prepared for this outbreak for a number of years, and are ready to help Canadians respond in an evidence-informed way.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "237787",
    "Abstract": "This research aims to assess the medium-run implications of COVID-19 on income and health inequality, and possible policies that aim to mitigate these effects. The medium run is important because the impacts of COVID-19 on inequality are expected to persist for many years. Understanding how inequality changes over the medium run, and assessing mitigation policies beyond the short term, requires information on the evolution of income and health inequalities several years after an outbreak. To achieve this, we will combine models typically applied to modern datasets with quantitative data from historical periods that, unlike contemporary data, cover extended post-outbreak periods. We will use records from Glasgow since the end of the 19th century, covering a period of intense and volatile economic activity, as well as multiple disease outbreaks. We choose Glasgow because it is a large city demonstrating similar inequalities to those seen today, and because administrative records for Glasgow provide detailed relevant information.\n\nOur approach is the following. We will use a modelling framework that has been shown to be effective in capturing income inequality and the effects of recessions on this inequality. We will extend the modelling approach to also include health inequalities and ensure that both income and health inequalities are represented accurately using recent datasets. To set up the model so that it captures the effects of outbreaks on inequalities, we will use historical data from earlier times that include large disease outbreaks. The model will then allow us to examine the effects of different policy interventions for households with different socioeconomic characteristics.",

    "Abstract": "Research Questions 1. What are the differences between expected and observed NHS activity for children and young people (CYP; 0-24 years) during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave and over the next year, and how does this vary by setting, diagnostic category and patient characteristics 2. For which patient groups is the pandemic period linked with adverse outcomes Background CYP health and wellbeing have been markedly affected by the response to the COVID-19 pandemic despite experiencing few direct effects from infection with SARS-CoV-2. Children s services were markedly disrupted during the pandemic and these disruptions continue, resulting in a mix of health harms and benefits for CYP that are poorly understood. Aims Short-term: To inform planning for winter and future pandemic waves; to use health service use data as a proxy for health outcomes and understand the mix of harms and benefits arising from reduced activity during the first wave Medium term: To use insights from analysis of COVID impact and new metrics to inform healthcare policy, in particular the development of integrated care systems and population health management at STP/ICS level (ie to build back better ). Methods: Mixed-methods: Participatory work with CYP and professionals together with secondary analyses of administrative healthcare datasets. Workpackage (WP) 1: Patient/public involvement and expert consultation work Focus groups and online consultation work with CYP and consultation/consensus exercises with RCPCH subspeciality groups and other relevant stakeholders, including charities. WP2: Analysis of trends in primary care and hospital activity Datasets: Secondary Users Survey (SUS), Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD), ONS Mortality data, RCGP dataset We will: Calculate ratios of observed:expected NHS activity for CYP (0-24 years) during the initial Covid-19 period and subsequently. Expected (denominator) rates will be modelled using 5 years historical data, thus accounting for seasonal variation, secular activity trends and coding changes over time. Separate analyses will be performed by setting, diagnostic category and patient characteristics (including age, sex, deprivation, ethnicity, geographical location) Estimate impact of reduced activity on health outcomes Estimate cumulative unmet need for care WP3: Analysis of new linked datasets. We will explore wider Covid-19 impact through new data linkages, with a range of planned linked datasets accessed through NHS England and PHE. Timelines for Delivery The project will run for 18 months from November 2020 (Month 1) to May 2022 (M18). WP1 will run M1 to 18 WP2 will run M1 to 12 WP3 will run M6 to 18 Anticipated Impact and Dissemination As a partnership between two universities and three key national bodies, this project will have rapid and meaningful impact on major policy decisions, as well as influencing local service planning across the country. We will disseminate findings through PPI partners, academic publications and directly to policymakers, particularly NHS England and regions.",

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. It seems highly likely that SARS-CoV-2 will cause disease and mortality unprecedented in modern times. Despite rapid publication of data from China, many unanswered questions remain that have immediate bearing on control and treatment of COVID-19: ? Pathogen: how does transmission occur and over what period? What features of the virus drive transmission and severity? ? Host: How can diagnosis be improved? How can severity be predicted? Does prior immunity to other viruses worsen disease severity? How does (non)pulmonary organ injury occur? Can therapy be tailored according to disease mechanisms? Which bacterial or fungal co-infections contribute to critical illness? This is a new disease. There is a high chance that clinical trials will fail to detect therapeutic effects, by enrolling at the wrong time, or missing key subgroups or endpoints. Deep biological phenotyping can mitigate these risks, providing rapid, efficient clinical evidence. Our response has been planned and tested over the past 8 years within the International Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium (ISARIC). We will recruit at least the first 1300 consenting UK patients, and 1000 suspected cases, as the base of a coordinated national response, using our established, internationally-harmonized protocol (ISARIC Clinical Characterisation Protocol) to: ? Provide a unified foundation for clinical trials, enriching design and interpretation ? Provide an open-access platform for evaluation of diagnostics and therapeutics ? Establish a sample repository with independently-managed availability to researchers and to industry. ? Use real-time data to inform the response by funders, public health and hospitals ISARIC-4C is a consortium of experts with a proven track record of high-quality outbreak research. We have already recruited 87% of cases reported in the UK.",

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. Some additional funds were added in January 2022 to be paid by NIHR only. EAVE (Early Estimation of vaccine and Anti-Viral Effectiveness) was a NIHR-funded project on pandemic influenza, which created a Scotland-wide cohort of 227,000 individuals recruited from 40 general practices together with stored serology samples from 1,000 individuals. EAVE established a national electronic cohort though linking health data sets from general practice, prescribing, hospitalisations and virology testing using the unique Community Health Identification (CHI) number for residents of Scotland. We plan to repurpose and expand this cohort to collect electronic data from 1.2m individuals living in Scotland to study COVID-19. We will augment the cohort by collecting and storing residual sera samples and by sequencing virus from patient specimens. Both of these, are being taken as part of routine care from a sample of these individuals. We will track the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic in near real-time using the EAVE II cohort. We will be able to model the full course of the epidemic from genome sequence data. Once a serological test becomes available we will be able to refine this model and provide precise estimates of the attack rates in different sub-populations, and accompanying hospitalisation and fatality rates. EAVE II will help to identify the clinical features of the epidemic and, in due course, provide estimates of the effectiveness of any vaccines and anti-viral therapies deployed. Ethical and Privacy Committee approval has previously been given for the EAVE study and we anticipate the same approvals will readily be obtained for this follow-on study.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "542256",
    "Abstract": "discovery - Coronaviruses (CoVs) show striking differences in their pathogenicity, ranging from harmless colds to severe respiratory infections after viral zoonoses with fatality rates of up to 40% in the case of MERS-CoV. With death rates of ~9% and ~0.3-3.4%, respectively, SARS-CoV and the emerging SARS-CoV-2 fall between these extremes. The reasons for this different pathogenicity are poorly understood. However, host immunity and viral adaptation to humans most likely play key roles. Studies on highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV revealed that they evolved various mechanisms to suppress innate immune sensing and interferon production as well as to antagonize antiviral factors. Counteraction of our immune defense impedes viral control and may be a prerequisite for high virulence. I hypothesize that counteraction of innate immunity together with untimely activation of inflammation have a major impact on CoV pathogenesis. To address this, I propose to perform comparative analyses of human CoVs, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and their closest animal counterparts for their ability to suppress or counteract innate immunity. Initially, we will determine the expression of viral immune sensors and antiviral factors in primary lung cells. To define determinants of virus transmission and pathogenesis, we will analyze the capability of proteins from various CoVs to manipulate immune sensors, signaling molecules, and antiviral effectors. In addition, we will examine whether it is possible to modulate the innate immune response to achieve efficient control or tolerance of SARS-CoV-2.",

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. Efficient response to COVID-19 requires an understanding of the epidemiological and behavioural drivers of disease transmission. Due to the rapidly evolving outbreak and the mitigation strategies likely to be put in place at different times, analyses of epidemic drivers and policy evaluation need constant updating to provide relevant data-driven evidence to inform evolving public health choices. We will provide rapid, continually updated estimates of key epidemiological features such as disease severity and transmissibility measures and lengths of stay. Surveillance, serological and sequence data (where available) will be analysed accounting for censoring and reporting delays. Mathematical models will be fit to the emerging data streams using Bayesian methods to provide regular forecasting updates and assess the impact of current or potential future interventions. Contact and precautionary behaviours will be monitored in a representative cohort along with information on risk awareness and perceived efficacy of interventions to refine transmission models, improve forecasting, and assess the effectiveness of social distancing measures. Special attention will be given to sharing results in an open and timely manner. Epidemiological parameter estimates and forecasts will be shared on a public website, updated daily. User-friendly web interfaces will allow users to generate model outputs and investigate the impact of specific model assumptions on different policy findings. Highlights of essential results will be gathered in short policy briefs updated weekly. Findings will immediately inform UK policy through participation on UK Government advisory committees.",

In this project, we will test nutraceuticals (i.e., bioactive molecules from food) to see if they bind to and inhibit the entry of the virus into the cell. Interestingly, using computer modeling, nutraceuticals have been predicted to bind to SARS-CoV-2. In aim 1, we will directly test if nutraceuticals bind to the virus and prevent its entry into the cell. In aim 2, we will determine the dosing strategy (i.e., how much and how often you need to take the supplement so that the nutraceutical can get to the lungs and bind to the virus) to provide maximal protection. In aim 3, we will test the nutraceuticals anti-viral effects in mouse models. Through this work, we will directly determine which nutraceutical can bind to and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a new approach to reducing the risk of infection.",

    "Abstract": "This project is framed in the area of \"crisis informatics\", the study of how (mis)information\nabout COVID-19 is generated and flows over media platforms. The main goal is that of\nreverse-engineering the manipulation of information providing citizens with the means to act\nas fact checkers. We believe that fostering global digital activism constitutes a necessary\nmeans to fight the current info-pandemic. The majority of fact-checking and myth-busting\nsites (e.g. EUvsDisinfo, https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-\n2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters) counter false narratives and news that have already\nbecome viral, unable to prevent their spread. Furthermore, AI techniques\n(http://www.fakenewschallenge.org) are currently not accurate enough to replace humans\nin generalised fact-checking. This is especially the case when the news does not contain\nfabricated information (disinformation), but it is framed in such a way that true evidence is\nused to draw false generalizations and evaluations (Wardle 2019), resulting in semi-fake\nnews.\nLeveraging NLP techniques for topic modelling and frame analysis (Das et al. 2010) we will\ntrace the topics and frames which characterize semi-fake COVID-19 news using FullFact\n(https://fullfact.org/) and the Coronavirus debunking archive built by First Draft\n(https://firstdraftnews.org/long-form-article/coronavirus-resources-for-reporters/) as\nbenchmarks. We will identify the fallacious reasonings in the sample and use the results to\ncompile a set of guidelines about how to detect semi-fake COVID-19 news.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project. ChAdOx1 is a replication-deficient simian adenoviral vector that provides a platform technology for the production of vaccines against many infectious diseases. For Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, a single dose of the ChAdOx1-vectored MERS vaccine resulted in protection against MERS challenge in non-human primates and the induction of strong humoral and T cell responses in a Phase I clinical trial. The same vaccine design has now been followed to produce ChAdOx1 nCoV. Preclinical studies of the vaccine will be initiated by the end of February. This will include demonstration of vaccine immunogenicity (antibody and T cell) in mice, followed by vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy against nCoV-19 challenge in ferrets and non-human primates with collaborators at PHE Porton Down and NIH. A pre-GMP vaccine seed stock is in production at Oxford?s GMP manufacturing facility, and will be provided to Advent, Italy, which will produce the first 1000 doses for clinical studies. In parallel with preclinical studies and vaccine manufacturing, Oxford will work with the MHRA on a rapid release testing package. This will employ deep sequencing of the Cell Harvest and Drug Substance to identify any potential replication competent adenovirus and adventitious agents rather than following the existing set of in vivo and in vitro assays, greatly reducing the time to cGMP certification. A phase I/II clinical trial will then be undertaken to demonstrate vaccine safety and immunogenicity in adults, older adults and children.",

We aim to provide, in <6 months and probably c. 4 months -A GMP process to produce the University of Oxford?s (UOXF?s) simian adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine at 200L/ c. 1m-dose scale -With MHRA engagement, a contingency plan (subject to funding) to make available 1m doses of GMP-like UK-cleanroom-produced material for clinical use as soon as possible. -Development of options for 1000L-scale (>5m dose) manufacturing in UK & abroad. Small-batch GMP and clinical trials of the UOXF vaccine are already planned. Supported by the extensive human safety/ immunogenicity record of these vectors, and anticipating supportive primate efficacy/ immunopathology safety data in April, we are contingency planning an emergency clinical trial programme. With a œ0.25m in-kind contribution from PallBiotech, including access to a fully-equipped process development (PD) facility, and starting from our existing GMP 3L-scale process, we are already performing scale-up preparation experiments and anticipate a 50L run at Pall?s facility and then 200L runs as needed, within funds requested here. With Co-I J Humphreys (VMIC), we are contingency planning near-immediate access to 200L-capable cleanrooms at two CDMOs, both partners in this application (Cobra in Keele, UK & Halix in Leiden NL). We have requested an emergency meeting with MHRA to discuss regulatory mechanisms to make vaccine available for large-scael use as soon as possible.",

    "Abstract": "Viruses rely on interactions with cellular proteins in order to replicate, transmit efficiently and to cause disease. Our knowledge on interactions of coronavirus (CoV) proteins with cellular proteins is still very limited. This is particularly true for the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19. However, such virus-host protein-protein information would not only be highly relevant to understand the biology of CoVs but also to establish intellectually designed therapies. Here we propose to join forces of two laboratories with expertise in CoV biology and viral ? host protein interactions to chart the interface between coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and less pathogenic human CoVs) and the cellular proteome. This network of proteins will be complemented with information druggability of individual proteins in order to identify candidate proteins or drugs, which potentially modulate SARS-CoV-2 spread or pathology. We anticipate that this information will be of critical support for the current endeavour to establish therapies against Covid-19.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "1049793",
    "Abstract": "In December 2019 a novel coronavirus (CoV) was identified as the cause of pneumonia in a cluster of patients in Wuhan, China. This virus is related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and has been named SARS-CoV-2. In less than two months, there have been over 69,000 cases and over 1600 deaths. Quarantine measures have been imposed on entire cities in China in an attempt to control spread. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in 28 other countries and there is concern that this could lead to global pandemic. Here we propose to identify what common lab and agricultural animals may be infected with SARS-CoV-2. This addresses two important questions. What animals can be infected and may pose a risk (or are at risk) and can these animals be used to models. Animal model allow us to understand how the virus causes disease, whether vaccines can be developed that protect from disease and how might the virus be transmitted. These are critical questions that need to be addressed when a new pathogen emerges. In addition, there is some concern that less than optimal vaccines or previous exposure to related pathogens could exaserbate disease - this is a somewhat unique phenomenom that was observed with SARS-CoV vaccines. We plan to investigate whether these animal models can be used to test for this, to ensure that vaccines are safe prior to testing in human clinical trials",

    "Abstract": "Under the leadership of the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Infectious Diseases, Research Methods and Recommendations and Cochrane Canada, this project will support Canada's contribution to the global response to the COVID-19 outbreak by bringing together world-class institutions in prioritizing, conducting and mapping synthesized evidence, and in developing clinical, public health and health policy recommendations to research critical questions of global importance for COVID-19. The aims of this project are to provide efficient, easy-to-navigate, adaptable, and freely accessible quality-appraised COVID-19 evidence and recommendations for different stakeholders. For the first aim, we will systematically identify and critically review and map relevant evidence to support researchers and guideline developers in finding the available relevant evidence to their needs, all in one living evidence map. This work is ongoing in collaboration with the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. The second aim focuses on immediately and longitudinally collecting all trustworthy COVID-19 recommendations and create a platform that allows decision-makers to 1) easily locate specific recommendations and the information that supports it, 2) contextualize these recommendation through the GRADE approach, supported by capacity-building for contextualization by the central team for various jurisdictions, and 3) provide continuous feedback to support the research optimizing the work on the platform. We are unaware of any other research team developing living recommendations in relation to COVID-19 that can be contextualized and allow a centralized collection and provision of evidence about this contextualization from various jurisdictions worldwide. This work highlights the novelty of the two-way iterative interaction among the map, the team, and stakeholders.",

    "Abstract": "A new virus has been identified from Wuhan City in China from the coronavirus family (SARS-CoV-2), which is now responsible for more than 71,000 cases of illness (COVID-19 disease) in over 29 countries. Although there have not yet been any deaths in Canada, public health agencies are on high alert, as there is a real possibility of a serious epidemic. The WHO has declared COVID- 19 a public health emergency of international concern. As of February 14th, five COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in British Columbia and based on travel patterns there is every reason to expect additional cases in BC. There are many unanswered questions regarding the virus, how it spreads and the disease that it causes. This information is needed for a data-driven response to this outbreak. We aim to use two types of next-generation data (next-gen genomics data and next-gen human data), along with a data integration tool called PLOVER 2.0, to answer these unknowns. The research team will 1)Carry out rapid genomic sequencing on patient samples to study the virus, how it spreads, how it evolves and predict which drugs will work 2)Develop knowledge of how the virus characteristics, along with a patient's previous health conditions, impact the severity of illness and how they recover from the illness 3)Develop a software tool (PLOVER 2.0) that will allow us to carry out this research and will also make the data viewable by key stakeholders such as Medical Health Officers. This work will not only generate critical knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 virus but will also help develop a better understanding of health outcomes for infected patients. The knowledge generated and tools developed by this research can ensure an evidence-based and cohesive response to this public health emergency, here in Canada and internationally.",

    "Abstract": "Key to an effective response to the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is a method to rapidly identify emergency department patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 and are at high risk of progressing to severe illness and death. At University Health Network, our team represents a deeply experienced group of critical care doctors and infectious disease researchers who can immediately respond to the global need to provide an accurate diagnosis of respiratory illness-the main feature of COVID-19-at the front lines of patient care. We have recently developed a 40 minute diagnostic test to determine lung quality for transplantation. Recent scientific studies from China clearly show that the body's development of respiratory distress as a response to potential COVID-19 infection produces an identical injury profile that would be detected by our diagnostic test. We will work alongside SQI Diagnostics, our Canadian partner committed to developing diagnostics for lung health, to adapt our test towards the development of RALI-Dx (Rapid Acute Lung Injury Diagnostic). This diagnostic can be used by hospital emergency departments to screen for lung sickness and the likelihood of COVID-19 infection. An important part of our CIHR-supported research study is a commitment from our Chinese collaborators to safely test our diagnostic first on COVID-19+ blood samples to make sure the test is highly accurate before hospital use. With our 40 minute RALI-Dx test, we will: -Quickly identify the highest risk patients in need of immediate care -Identify lower risk patients who require at-home monitoring -Reduce the current major stress on health care facilities Additionally, new COVID-19 therapies are being rapidly developed around the world, and the first step will be to identify which patients will benefit the most from these treatments. With RALI-Dx, hospitals everywhere can better manage patient care and provide an accelerated response to the COVID-19 outbreak.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "836425",
    "Abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) and Coronavirus (CoV) are single-stranded RNA viruses that pose grave threat to public health. In the first two decades of the 21st century, the global community has already witnessed one outbreak of Flavivirus, Zika virus (ZIKV), and three zoonotic outbreaks of CoV? severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in2012, and the most recent, the novel SARS-CoV-2. These viruses are highly transmissible, greatly impacting the social, societal and economic dynamics. However, there are currently no approved drugs for either ZIKV or for zoonotic CoV, raising an urgent need for development of novel therapeutic strategies against ZIKV and CoV infection. This application seeks to develop an antiviral strategy targeting the viral core replication machinery, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), non-structural protein 5 (NS5) of ZIKV and non-structural protein 12 (NSP12) of SARS-CoV-2. On one hand, the currently identified small molecule inhibitors will be evaluated for their efficiency on ZIKV or SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. On the other hand, mechanistic details of ZIKV NS5 and SARS-CoV-2 RdRP-mediated RNA replication will be investigated, thereby providing a basis for development of synergistic inhibition strategies targeting various enzymatic steps of ZIKV NS5 and SARS-CoV-2. In Aim 1, structural, biochemical and cellular approaches will be taken to evaluate the inhibition of ZIKVNS5- or SARS-CoV-2 RdRP-mediated de novo RNA synthesis by candidate inhibitors. Through evaluation of the inhibitory effects of the candidate inhibitors on ZIKV NS5 or SARS-CoV-2 RdRP, this application will address whether these compounds can serve as inhibitors to ZIKV NS5 or SARS-CoV-2, and more importantly, to provide a basis for structure-based drug optimization for ZIKV NS5 or SARS-CoV-2. In Aim 2, the mechanistic basis of ZIKV NS5 and SARS-CoV-2 RdRP-mediated RNA replication will be determined through structure elucidation of the replication complexes of ZIKV NS5 or SARS-CoV-2 RdRP, combined with enzymatic analyses. The structural knowledge on the replication complexes of ZIKV NS5 and SARS-CoV-2RdRP will then provide a framework for structure-based drug design for comprehensive inhibition of ZIKV NS5and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, the proposed studies will provide key mechanistic insights into the viral RdRP-mediated genome replication and establish a foundation for development of effective inhibitors against ZIKV and SARS-CoV-2.",

We will focus on potential comorbidity from infectious diseases with 3 different transmission routes and on interventions to mitigate risk. 1) Leptospirosis and enteric infections, environmentally transmitted. 2) Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya, caused by mosquito-borne pathogens. 3) Directly transmitted infections. Interventions will be chosen by the residents, facilitated by our team - either environmental (eg closing sewers) or behavioural (eg improving access to health visitors). Work will be based in 3 communities in Salvador Brazil. Biannual serosurveys will evaluate changes in incidence rates for diseases before, during and after interventions, as well as data on multiple aspects of knowledge, attitudes and practices, environmental data in public, peri-domestic, and domestic areas, the presence, extent and location of open sewers and trash accumulation, and relevant water/soil samples to quantify pathogen loads. Initially, communities will use previously- and newly-collected data as a basis for identifying interventions and relevant metrics to evaluate them. Further pre-intervention metrics will be collected during months 3-9. At the end of the first year, community-specific interventions will be implemented and further data collected. After a further 9 months the management groups will undertake an evidence-based assessment of the interventions' effectiveness, leading to a re-considered, modified, set of interventions (or a decision to maintain the status quo), followed by further data collection and ultimately to a full assessment of both interventions.\n",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "155280",
    "Abstract": "Despite the vast diversity of arboviruses endemic in East Africa, most research efforts have focused on just a few key viral pathogens. Additionally, estimates of arbovirus diversity in the tropics are likely to be underestimated, especially in Anopheles spp. Many arboviruses are vertically transmitted in mosquitoes, as are recently identified clades of insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFVs). Some ISFVs can either inhibit or enhance replication of other arboviruses in mosquitoes and thus impact both horizontal and vertical transmission of arboviruses. However, whether Anopheles-specific flaviviruses affect arbovirus or malaria (Plasmodium) transmission remains unknown. This study will 1) culture these viruses in Anopheles cell lines and examine their effect on secondary arbovirus inoculations; 2) secondarily infect Anopheles gambiae with arboviruses (Wesselsbron , Semliki Forest, and o?nyong-nyong viruses) after infection with ANFV; 3) characterise vector and viral gene expression responses to primary AnFV infections and with arbovirus infections using transcriptome sequencing; and 4) investigate the effects of AnFVs on Plasmodium transmission. The results from this study will inform on the potential utility of vertically transmitted AnFVs for blocking the transmission of arboviruses and or malaria parasites in Anopheles mosquitoes.\n",

    "Abstract": "Flaviviruses such as Zika virus, dengue virus and yellow fever virus transmit their RNA genomes between arthropods and humans, causing widespread pathology and death. During infection, the viral RNA genome resides inside the host cells? cytoplasm. However, whether the viral genome folds differently inside human and arthropod cells, and whether it interacts with the hosts? own RNA remain largely unexplored. The aim of this proposal is to dissect the dynamics and function of the flaviviral RNA interactome. I will employ my recent developed COMRADES method to investigate the base pairing capacity and function of two related flaviviruses: Zika virus and yellow fever virus, and to address the following little-explored aspects in their biology: (i) Do viral genomes base-pair with host RNAs? What are the roles of host-virus RNA base-pairing? (ii) Do viral genomes base-pair differently inside different hosts? What are the functional implications? The results will cast light on how RNA viruses utilise RNA base-pairing to enhance their replication and pathogenicity; offer new opportunities to develop antiviral therapeutics targeting the host-virus RNA-RNA interactome; and establish a new role for RNA base-paring in zoonosis.\n",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "Unspecified",
    "Abstract": "Several viruses have the ability to invade the Central Nervous System (CNS), infecting resident cells and causing severe neuroinflammation by activating the innate immune system. Exacerbated inflammatory responses are influenced by the activation of inflammasomes, which are multiprotein platforms present in the cytosol of different cell types capable of activating the caspase-1 protease, leading to the secretion of IL-1ý / IL-18 and cell death by pyroptosis. It has been shown that the Zika virus (ZIKV) modulates the activation of inflammasomes in different cell types. However, ZIKV mainly infects the CNS cells, and the role of inflammasome activation in these cells is not well established. Respiratory viruses can also damage the CNS similar as other well-known human neuroinvasive viruses. In this sense, SARS-Cov2 infection is increasingly being linked to neurological damage. It is known that infection with the new coronavirus stimulates a storm of inflammatory cytokines promoting Acute Respiratory Difficulty Syndrome (ARDS), fibrosis, hematological and neurological disorders, among others, which can result in organ failure and death. Recently, it was described the correlation between the activation of inflammasomes and the severity of COVID-19. However, the role of these platforms in the SNC is still unknown. Thus, considering the crucial role of inflammasomes for the host's response to pathogens and the potential of these platforms to exacerbating neuropathologies, the objective of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms by which inflammasomes are modulated in response to viral infections in murine and human CNS cells and its consequences for the control of infection and neuroinflammation.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "497035",
    "Abstract": "The aim of this project is to progress the clinical development of a new bivalent vaccine that judiciously induces simultaneous protection against Zika and chikungunya viruses (ZIKV and CHIKV). These two diseases are transmitted by the same mosquito specie as dengue, therefore causing a severe disease burden in the same geographical regions and in the same populations, particularly in low-and-middle-income countries. There is currently no vaccine to prevent Zika or chikungunya infections, and while any one vaccine would be particularly useful to reduce the disease burden in these vulnerable populations, a bivalent vaccine would further support global health by simplifying vaccination campaigns at lower costs when compared to single vaccine campaigns. Infection by ZIKV is a major concern worldwide due to causing neurologic conditions, such as Guillain-Barr‚ syndrome and a 20-fold increase in the incidence of neonatal microcephaly. Infection by CHIKV results in a flu-like symptomatic disease in approximately three quarters of infected people, and may lead to painful and debilitating long-term arthritis in patients of all ages. Persistent arthritis may last for years causing disability and inability to work. Long-term sequelae and lack of specific treatment for ZIKV and CHIKV infections contribute to poverty and high costs for families and governments in areas where the health system is weak and already overwhelmed by other arbovirus diseases such as dengue or by unrelated outbreaks such as SARS-CoV-2\\. Socioeconomical factors such as poverty and migration, together with climate change, increase the geographical regions where the mosquitoes live and transmit the viruses. A major breakthrough and an ideal preventive solution would be to provide a bivalent vaccine to simultaneously fight Zika and chikungunya. This proposal aims to leverage the findings and samples collected during a Phase Ib trial that has been completed in Mexico, where both diseases are prevalent. This 12-month project will enable the partners to advance the technical tools and collaborations ready for a phase IIb clinical trial.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "487363",
    "Abstract": "Zika virus is a common mosquito spread viral infection that usually causes mild fever but in pregnant women may damage the unborn baby and cause major disability. Children are born with small heads and suffer intellectual and physical impairment. This has been a particular problem in south and central America in recent years but zika infection is also present in many countries in tropical regions. No treatment for zika virus infection is available thus prevention by vaccination is desirable. However any vaccine should be safe to use in young and pregnant women to safeguard the mother and child from harm.\n\nWe have designed and produced a zika vaccine by incorporating bits of the zika virus genetic code in a smallpox vaccine. The smallpox vaccine has been chosen as it has been used to make other vaccines previously, it has a strong track record of safety and this particular vaccine cannot make copies of itself when injected in a human and therefore should to be safe when used in pregnancy. MVA is not owned by anyone, therefore the vaccine manufacture should prove relatively inexpensive and the vaccine made available at a price suitable for low and middle income countries.\n\nThe bits of the zika vaccine that have been included incorporate several components that allow the immune system to generate multiple immune responses, which we believe will provide a more protective vaccine and work better in areas of the world where zika circulates.\n\nOur vaccine is known as MVAZIKAB. It has completed laboratory studies prior to use in humans and to date has been shown to produce a strong immune response that protects against zika infection in mice. It has been manufactured so it is now suitable for use in humans. We will undertake the immunisation of the first healthy volunteers in early 2022\\. If as we expect these initial studies prove safe we will extend the study to increase the number of healthy volunteers to get a better understanding of immune response. However and importantly, we will give the vaccine to a small number of healthy volunteers who have been exposed to other infections similar to zika. This will be a common occurrence if we are to use this vaccine in areas of the world where zika circulates and ensuring safety and immune response in this group will provide reassurance for further studies in endemic regions of south America.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "462462",
    "Abstract": "Our team has already developed a fast, low cost and effective DNA vaccine that stimulates potent immune responses for COVID-19 and its variants in mice. This has entered human trials aiming to demonstrate safe and effective vaccination and immune booster deployment. This approach can also be used to develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection by flaviviruses such Dengue and Zika. Like other Zika vaccines being developed, ours will help the body to make antibodies to stop the Zika virus entering cells and causing the person to become infected. What makes this vaccine different from other approaches is that it will also stimulate the immune system to make special T cells that can recognise and kill cells that may have been infected with the virus. These T cells will also remain in the body longer than antibodies and be there in case of future infections. The proposed Zika vaccine will be generated as several variants targeting either a non-structural protein made by the virus, or a defective intact virus using DNA as the template. Most DNA vaccines under trial are administered using mild electric shock (electroporation) or pressure to increase efficacy of the DNA delivered. Although this approach works it requires an expensive device to deliver the vaccine. This is not practical when millions of healthy subjects will need to be immunised, as during the COVID-19 pandemic, or in potential future pandemics of flaviviruses like Zika. To overcome this problem, we have developed an elegant system to allow the DNA to be given by simple injection. This technology is called GET and we have modified this system to enhance the activity of vaccination for COVID-19 using polymer chemistry. Our aim is to test the new Zika vaccines we engineer by vaccinating mice and at the end of the project be positioned to allow us and our Brazilian collaborators to start human trials quickly and validate our novel DNA approach in Brazil, a country significantly affected by Zika. This strategy could have a transformative impact on pandemic prevention in the developing world and globally. Importantly this will allow a new class of DNA vaccines to be employed for many other diseases allowing us to be better prepared for the next pandemic.",

    "Abstract": "Globally in 2017, about 5.5 million children were born with congenital anomalies (CAs). As the fifth leading cause of death for children under-five, CAs were responsible for 584,900 deaths, over 10% of all under-five deaths. An estimated 96% of deaths related to CA occur in LMIC including Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe rationale for this network rests on three pillars:\n1) CA (structural anomalies present at birth) are important contributors to stillbirths and neonatal mortality and morbidity and disability in Africa and thus improving prevention and care is important for the attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 3.\n2) Special problems exist in Africa relating to CAs including underdiagnoses, poor reporting, cultural/ stigma, little access to care, maternal nutritional, infectious and environmental causes, and post-surgical mortality.\n3) There are few established CA surveillance centres in Africa and no co-ordination or networking. Recent concerns regarding antiretroviral safety in pregnancy, and the Zika virus epidemic, have reinforced calls for effective surveillance.\n\nThe network aims to promote the prevention of CA, and care for affected children and families, by building an evidence base through surveillance and research, improving capacity for collaborative research, and paving an impact pathway on policy and practice.\n\nObjectives of this Seed Project are:\n- To establish a Sub-Saharan African network for CA: Surveillance, Prevention and Care.\n- To develop a position paper \"The Burden of Birth Defects in Sub-Saharan Africa\" in order to make an appropriate case for national funding of public health actions, care services and surveillance relating to CA\n- To scope potential harnessing of new technologies\n\nStarting with 9 African countries and global partners, this multidisciplinary network will include paediatricians, epidemiologists, geneticists, pediatric surgeons, social scientists, patient organisations, ministries of health, and academia.\n",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "248999",
    "Abstract": "The number of vector-borne disease cases in the US has tripled over the past decade and these pathogens including mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) remain an apparent threat to general public health. The ZIKV outbreaks in the Americas and Southeast Asia is a major global health concern, largely due to the association with fetal craniofacial abnormalities and malformations, resulting from prenatal infection. Although ZIKV infection during pregnancy is casually associated with microcephaly, it is important to note that intracranial calcification is the most frequent abnormality present in ZIKV-positive babies. In fact, Magnetic Resonance Imaging study of Brazilian large ZIKV-positive baby cohort reported the intracranial calcifications as the most common clinical observations. While calcification occurs in soft tissues, the abnormal deposition of calcium in brain not only severely affects motor function, speech ability, and vision, but also causes seizures. Despite the growing clinical evidences of ZIKV-induced calcifications and their potential dire outcomes, however, the etiology and molecular mechanisms of ZIKV-induced brain calcification remain elusive. My preliminary observations in ZIKV human fetal brain specimens showed that high level of calcium deposits was localized with virus-infected perivascular cells. Intriguingly, ZIKV-infection of brain perivascular and osteogenic precursor cells robustly induced calcifications in vitro. Surprisingly, the induction of calcification was lineage-specific to the Asian ZIKV strains, but not to the African ZIKV strains. African ZIKV strains rapidly replicated, inducing cell death, while Asian ZIKV strains persistently replicated, leading to aberrant calcium deposition. Surprisingly, ZIKV expression library screen showed that NS3 protease was sufficient to induce calcification. Based on these preliminary data, I hypothesize that ZIKV targets specific host brain perivascular cells and utilizes NS3 protease to induce intracranial calcifications, which ultimately contributes to virus-associated congenital abnormality. Herein, I seek to address the following questions: (i) which host cells are targeted for ZIKV-induced calcifications, and (ii and iii) which and how ZIKV NS3 protease triggers abnormal calcification during infection. This proposal is highly innovative and translational, and potentially shed new insights to ZIKV-induced intracranial calcification that is the most frequent abnormality present in virus-infected babies.",

    "Abstract": "Clinically normal children exposed to Zika-virus (ZIKV) in utero may evidence abnormal neurodevelopment during the first few years of life even in the absence of the severe phenotype of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). This is an important problem because the majority of children with in utero ZIKV exposure do not develop CZS but are at risk for neurodevelopmental abnormalities as they mature. The risk for neurodevelopmental impairments at school age in children with in utero ZIKV exposure, who do not have CZS, is not known because children have neither reached nor been studied at this critical age. The long-term goal is to recognize the spectrum of neurologic outcomes for children exposed to ZIKV in utero, which will enable appropriate follow-up guidelines, educational interventions, and therapies to support all children exposed to ZIKV. The objective of this application is to identify school age abnormalities in neurodevelopment and the domains affected and to evaluate for brain structural and functional differences among children in Colombia and in the US with ZIKV exposure in utero who do not have CZS. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will test two specific hypotheses: 1) that executive and motor function will be negatively impacted in ZIKV-exposed children compared to controls; and 2) that quantitative imaging will find structural and functional brain differences between ZIKV-exposed children and controls. The children will be followed at age 5 and 7 years using a specifically designed set of neurodevelopmental assessment tools and quantitative structural and functional neuroimaging. Neurodevelopment will be assessed by an approach utilizing validated questionnaires and child assessments that measure executive function, behavior, motor function, and intellectual ability. The advanced brain MRI will provide a multimodal assessment of brain structure and function. The approach is innovative because of access to two uniquely well characterized cohorts, one from the Caribbean coast of Colombia who had sequential fetal and neonatal neuroimaging and had early neurodevelopmental evaluations and a cohort from a congenital Zika program in the United States with exposure by travel or emigration. The proposed research is significant, because it will address a key question in child health by focusing on neurodevelopmental abnormalities in children following in utero ZIKV exposure that can manifest at school age. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to immediately inform the development of guidelines for neuropsychological and imaging assessment at school age for children with in utero exposure to ZIKV. Completion of the aims will improve identification of abnormal neurologic outcomes in children who had exposure to ZIKV in utero. The knowledge to be gained from this work is essential to be done now and is important to families, care providers, public health policy authorities, and federal agencies. It may be also applicable to future congenital infectious epidemics and potentially other perinatal exposures.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "751867",
    "Abstract": "Prenatal exposure to the Zika virus (ZIKV) poses a threat to the fetus, putting the neonate at risk for significant birth defects (termed congenital Zika syndrome) and neurodevelopmental deficits developing during early childhood. There are currently no predictors to indicate which children will develop deficits and the neuropathologies underlying these deficits is not defined. It is critical to predict which infants will later develop deficits to maximize long-term sensorimotor development and functional outcomes. Furthermore, understanding underlying neuropathogenesis is necessary to develop targeted interventions. The purpose of this grant is to define the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of ZIKV by rapidly obtaining data from highly controlled studies of rhesus macaques. Specifically, we will: Aim 1: Characterize sensorimotor neurodevelopmental outcomes in macaques with prenatal ZIKV expo- sure. Behavioral assessments focused on sensorimotor development may highlight the distinct developmental trajectories and increased deficits with age in ZIKV-exposed rhesus macaques. Because macaques develop more quickly than humans, sensorimotor neurodevelopmental differences that occur by year 3 may predict future impacts in children born with prenatal ZIKV exposure. Aim 2: Identify early neural predictors of sensorimotor neurodevelopmental deficits in ZIKV-exposed infant macaques with quantitative MRI, hearing and visual studies. We will describe differences between ZIKV-exposed and mock-infection control infants and identify individual differences within ZIKV-exposed infants to determine the full spectrum of brain abnormalities. Aim 3: Define neuropathology underlying sensorimotor neurodevelopmental deficits with quantitative brain histopathology. Using cellular quantification and organization of brain nuclei, we aim to identify the neuropathogenesis of congenital Zika syndrome to better create appropriate, targeted interventions for children. This study utilizes a large cohort of ZIKV-exposed infant macaques that have been born in other NIH-funded studies and capitalizes on our collaborative team of experts in neuropathology, neurodevelopment and neuroradiology.",

    "GrantTitleEng": "A novel live-attenuated Zika vaccine with a modified 5'UTR",
    "GrantAmountConverted": "444000",
    "Abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that has caused devastating congenital Zika syndromes (CZS), including microcephaly, congenital malformation, and fetal demise in human newborns in the 2015 - 2016 epidemics. In addition, ZIKV infection can cause Guillain-Barr‚ syndrome (GBS) and meningoencephalitis in adults. Currently, ZIKV pathogenesis is incompletely understood, and there is no approved therapeutic or vaccine available. Although the number of human Zika cases has dropped since 2017, ZIKV will likely become endemic, and a vaccine that can prevent CZS and adult Zika diseases remains urgently needed to prepare for future outbreaks. Our research group recently developed a new live-attenuated ZIKV strain (named Z7) by inserting a 50-RNA-nucleotides (nt) hairpin into the 5? untranslated region (UTR) of a pre-epidemic ZIKV Cambodian strain, FSS13025, which is attenuated in neurovirulence, immune antagonism, and mosquito infectivity compared with the American epidemic isolates. Our preliminary data demonstrate that Z7 replicates efficiently and produces high titers in Vero cells without causing apparent cytopathic effects (CPE) or losing the insert sequence even after ten consecutive passages. Interestingly, we identified a mutation S1417A in NS2B protein in Z7 after the 7th passage, indicating Z7 may have adapted a fitness mutation through the passaging. Importantly, Z7 induces sterilizing immunity that completely prevents viremia after a challenge with a high dose of an American epidemic strain (PRVABC59) in mice. These results suggest that modification of ZIKV 5?UTR is a novel strategy to develop live-attenuated vaccine candidates for ZIKV and potentially for other flaviviruses. In this application, we will first characterize Z7-induced humoral and cell-mediated immunity in a mouse model (Specific Aim 1), and then evaluate the safety features of Z7 in mice (Specific Aim 2). In Specific Aim 3, we will determine the mechanisms of action of Z7 attenuation. We believe that this project is highly significant because it will characterize the immunity and safety of a novel live-attenuated ZIKV vaccine candidate, Z7, which was developed for the first time by introducing a hairpin loop into a viral 5? UTR. In addition, this R15 project will also provide a valuable and unique training opportunity to both undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Southern Mississippi.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "516055",
    "Abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is associated with congenital ZIKV syndrome (CZS), including various brain anomalies and microcephaly. Our recent studies suggested that yolk sac (YS)-derived microglia (primary immune cells in the brain) and Peli1 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) are involved in ZIKV infection and its associated CZS. However, it is unknown whether and how Peli1 contributes to the YS-microglia-mediated spread of ZIKV into brain, whether viral infection affects the normal function of microglia, and how such effects influence neural differentiation. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that Peli1 plays a critical role in fetal brain ZIKV infection via promoting YS-microglia-mediated ZIKV dissemination into fetal brain and via altering microglial function to affect neural differentiation. This hypothesis will be tested by two specific aims: 1) to determine how Peli1 promotes ZIKV infection of YS-microglia and virus dissemination from microglia to neural stem cells in fetal brains; and 2) to determine how Peli1 mediates microglial activation and alters neural differentiation after ZIKV infection. This integrative study employs biochemical and genetic manipulations in both in vivo animal models and in vitro mouse and human cell platforms. The outcomes will be evaluated by molecular, cellular, and neuroanatomical analyses. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of microglia in ZIKV-related brain infection may lead to identification of new targets for prevention and treatment of ZIKV and other virus-mediated congenital neural infections.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "369974",
    "Abstract": "The massive outbreak of newly emerged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) saw rapid global spread, leading to a pandemic infection and an unprecedented global health emergency. Just years before, we witnessed the devastating impact of Zika virus (ZIKV) to unborn fetuses in the Americas. This proposal responds to the need to fill critical gaps in the understanding of the clinical repercussions of antenatal infections such as ZIKV and SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women to the developing immune system of their infants, through the evaluation of cellular and humoral immune responses and clinical and neurodevelopmental outcomes following maternal immune activation (MIA) in this vulnerable population. Our team of researchers has been collaborating over the last 7 years to characterize the clinical and cellular effects of in utero transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV), with the collection of specimens from over hundreds of mother- infant pairs from Brazil. We reported on multiple obstetrical and clinical outcomes of infants with congenital ZIKV infection in the literature, including that ZIKV vertical transmission rate is at least 65%, that infected children do not develop ZIKV specific neutralizing antibodies despite an early IgM response, and that maternal humoral immune responses tend to be robust with highly neutralizing activity. During the COVID-19 pandemic we established a cohort of mother-infant pairs at UCLA and Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro and controls with mother-infant dyads enrolled to date in both places. We are utilizing the existing infrastructure and scientific methods developed in the aftermath of the ZIKV epidemic to further evaluate clinical, cellular humoral and inflammatory parameters predicting immunologic outcomes in infants and children exposed to either maternal ZIKV and SARS Cov2 infection. The main goal of the proposed research is to comprehensively characterize repercussions of MIA on infant immune development and clinical outcomes, with a focus on immune pathogenesis. We include a longitudinal cohort of 200 mother-infant pairs with COVID-19 and 100 healthy control mother-infant pairs in the US and Brazil and 200 mother-infant pairs with ZIKV in Brazil and 100 healthy control pairs at the same clinical sites to address these goals. This RO1 proposes to evaluate the repercussions of MIA on infant well- being and immune development. State of the art technology is used to address the scientific aims, with the research led by experts in the field of immunology, infectious diseases & congenital infections who have ongoing successful, productive partnerships. The data rendered will be crucial for the knowledge of immune pathogenesis in pediatric populations with antenatal viral exposures.",

    "Abstract": "Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Infections in Pregnancy: Pathogenic Mechanisms, Experimental Advances and Clinical Strategies, organized by Drs. Helen Lazear, Carolyn Coyne and David Aronoff. The conference will be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico from January 22-25, 2023. The placenta generally provides a robust barrier to the fetal compartment across which relatively few microbes are able to penetrate, and functions together with other defenses at the maternal-fetal interface to protect against congenital infections. Nonetheless, congenital pathogens including human cytomegalovirus, Zika virus, Toxoplasma gondii, and group B streptococcus can cause fetal loss, growth restriction, birth defects, and developmental delays. The list of congenital pathogens continues to grow; for example, the recently emergent virus SARS-CoV-2, can cause devastating adverse pregnancy outcomes independent of vertical transmission. In addition to pathogenic effects on the fetus and neonate, infections during pregnancy can have distinct impacts on maternal health, owing to the physiologic and immunologic effects of pregnancy. As such, there is a need to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms of congenital infections and immune defenses at the maternal-fetal interface, as well as to develop improved vaccine, treatment, and diagnostic strategies to combat congenital infections. But in many cases these infections can be difficult to study due to limitations in experimental systems and challenges in designing studies with human patients. This Keystone Symposia conference will bring together researchers investigating infections in pregnancy from a range of perspectives including basic biology, pathogenesis models, clinical studies, and patient care. The program is designed to highlight the new advances in understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of congenital infections. Other sessions will share recent developments in experimental systems for studying congenital infections, in addition to providing details on the latest developments in vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. The program will also be designed to consider the effects of infections during pregnancy on maternal health, as well as on fetal, infant, and child health. This conference will provide an opportunity for researchers from diverse backgrounds to exchange ideas and develop new collaborations to promote future research on infections during pregnancy. Finally, this conference is being paired with another Keystone Symposia meeting on Maternal-Fetal Crosstalk. This will allow participants at both conference the chance to network and develop new collaborations through shared sessions and meals.",

    "Abstract": "The goal of this project is to discover novel broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitors. We will identify new broad- spectrum coronavirus inhibitors of viral replication using a cell-based approach. We will achieve the goal by pursuing three aims. (i) Screen and identify novel compounds for broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibition. We will screen and identify inhibitors of viral replication using SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and 229E infection assays. UTMB has developed an single-cycle infection system for SARS-CoV-2 that can be used for HTS campaign at BSL2. In this application, we will expand this system to MERS-CoV. We will also develop a reporter 229E coronavirus for antiviral screen. (ii) Develop tool compounds, determine target protein, and optimize molecules. (iii) Evaluate lead compounds in relevant in vitro and in vivo models and select Development Candidate for IND- enabling studies. The proposed cell-based approach may discover novel antiviral targets that may not be tractable for target-based antiviral approach.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "1000000",
    "Abstract": "Vaccination represents one of the most effective public health measures for protecting at risk populations from emerging pathogens. However, FDA approved vaccines are lacking for the vast majority of emerging pathogens, and therefore new vaccines and vaccination strategies are needed to protect susceptible populations from viruses such as MERS-CoV, Ebola virus (EBOV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Adjuvants represent an essential component of modern vaccinology, since recombinant protein or virus like particle (VLP) based vaccines are poorly immunogenic in the absence of adjuvant-mediated innate immune stimulation. In fact, a growing body of evidence suggests that combinations of adjuvants that stimulate multiple innate immune pathways are capable of eliciting broadly protective, long-lived immune responses similar to those stimulated by natural infections. However, to date, only a small number of adjuvants have been approved for human use, and we have a poor understanding of their mechanisms of action or the host susceptibility alleles that regulate their performance. This lack of knowledge impedes our ability to develop new adjuvants, while also limiting our capacity to rationally combine different adjuvants to develop broadly protective vaccine formulations. Furthermore, since the innate immune pathways targeted by both FDA approved and experimental adjuvants are highly polymorphic, it is likely that host genetic variation will significantly impact both the efficacy and safety of individual adjuvants across diverse populations. Therefore, the development of safe and effective adjuvants and vaccine formulations requires an understanding of how specific adjuvants/vaccines perform in diverse populations. Importantly, we can also take advantage of this diversity in responses to identify the polymorphic genes and genetic networks that regulate the response to specific adjuvants, and then use that information to rationally select adjuvant combinations designed to safely elicit durably protective immunity in at risk populations. Therefore, our Program, which takes advantage of our research team?s expertise in adjuvant development, vaccinology, and complex trait genetics, proposes to use advanced Systems Vaccinology and Genetics approaches to define the polymorphic genes/gene networks that regulate the response to specific adjuvants. We will then use this information to identify specific adjuvants or adjuvant combinations that will elicit protective immunity in populations who are at increased risk of vaccine failure. This program will results in several high impact deliverables, including: 1) broadly efficacious pre-IND vaccines for several high consequence emerging pathogens, including EBOV, influenza, MERS-CoV, and ZIKV, 2) novel adjuvant formulations that are designed to safely elicit durable protective immunity in genetically diverse populations, including individuals who are at risk of vaccine failure 3) improved animal models for testing vaccine safety and efficacy, and 4) general knowledge of adjuvant immune regulatory genes that will inform the development of new adjuvants with novel mechanisms of action and improved efficacy/safety profiles.",

    "GrantTitleEng": "Development of dual inhibitors targeting the viral main protease and the host cathepsin L as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals",
    "GrantAmountConverted": "730106",
    "Abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also called novel coronavirus 2019 (nCoV-19), started to circulate among humans around December 2019, and it is now widespread as a global pandemic. There is no vaccine or antiviral available for SARS-CoV-2. In this grant, we propose to develop dual inhibitors targeting viral main protease and cathepsin L as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, we recently identified several inhibitors including boceprevir, GC-376, and calpain inhibitors II and XII, that have potent activity with single-digit to submicromolar IC50 values in the enzymatic assay. Significantly, all four compounds inhibit infectious SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture with EC50 values ranging from 0.5 to 3.4 æM. Overall, the compounds identified provide promising starting points for the further development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Our discovery of calpain inhibitor II as a potent inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 is innovative as it suggests it might be feasible to develop SARS-CoV-2 antivirals by simultaneously targeting both viral Mpro and host cathepsin L, both of which are essential for viral replication. Compared to recently reported Mpro inhibitors, the hits identified from our study represent the most potent and selective drug candidates with a novel mechanism of action, therefore warranting further development. Given our encouraging preliminary data, we propose to optimize dual inhibitors as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. The objective of this proposal is to develop dual inhibitors as potent SARS-CoV-2 antivirals with high potency, selectivity, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, as well as broad-spectrum antiviral activity against closely related coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. Our goals of this grant are to identify additional dual inhibitors through both high-throughput screening and structure-based lead optimization of our recently identified dual inhibitors. By targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, the expected outcomes of the proposed research are broad-acting coronavirus antivirals with a confirmed mechanism of action, a high selectivity index, and favorable in vitro pharmacokinetic properties that are ready for in vivo antiviral efficacy testing in relevant animal models. Overall, this grant is based on strong preliminary data and our expertise in developing antivirals targeting cysteine proteases.",

    "Abstract": "Building on a successful GCRF Foundation Award, we aim to: i) Address knowledge gaps required to inform future vaccination strategies for MERS-CoV, ii) Develop and implement contextualized behavioural public health interventions to mitigate risk of MERS-CoV infection and iii) Build capacity for research, surveillance and control activities targeted at MERS-CoV.\nTwo parallel longitudinal studies of camel owning households and their camel herds, together with an ethnographic survey, will be conducted in southern Jordan (Ma'an and Aqaba governorates). These studies will address knowledge gaps identified through the Foundation Award as important to inform future vaccination strategies such as who should be targeted for vaccination and the sociocultural issues, including vaccine acceptability, that are likely to be faced. Appropriate hygiene education interventions will be introduced as part of a randomized pilot feasibility trial in which half of the households will be randomly selected at month 18th of the project, with the other half remaining as 'control arm' during the following 6 months. Primary outcomes of the trial will be obtained from interviews on acceptability, perceived difficulty in implementing together with reported and observed behaviour related to avoiding camel oral and nasal secretions. Secondary outcomes will be based on serology in humans and camels in those having had the intervention in first half of year two compared to those who have not yet had the intervention. We will exploit opportunities for capacity building through grass-roots and higher-level workshops and engagement activities with the support of Jordan's Royal Scientific Society and US NIH.\nThe importance , timeliness and opportunity of this project resides on the global public health threat posed by MERS-CoV, with Jordan as one of its epicenters, and the work carried out with the Foundation Award, which has generated knowledge and conditions that allow piloting of interventions.",

    "Abstract": "Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can infect mammals and birds. As has happened with SARS, MERS and Covid-19, viruses that infect animals can sometimes jump to infect humans and because humans have no protection against them, this can lead to epidemics or pandemics. In many low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) humans live in close proximity to animals and the infrastructure around animal health and meat trade may not be sufficient to guarantee that an infection from animals will not spread into humans. The risk of further epidemics or pandemics starting in LMICs is high and the world needs to prepare for that to mitigate the high mortality and the enormous burden to the global economy that diseases like Covid-19 cause.\n\nCovid-19 has drastically advanced the field of nucleic acid vaccines. It has taken decades to perfect the technology, devising methods to protect the nucleic acids and deliver them into the cells to allow synthesis of the protein encoded in the nucleic acid. This technology allows rapid vaccine design, targeting of specific cell types and extended protein production.\n\nConserV specialises in antigen discovery and has identified immunoreactive protein regions, known as antigens, that are common to the coronavirus family of viruses. These antigens have been encoded in mRNA to design a vaccine that aims to protect against a wide range of coronaviruses. This project will address optimisation of the mRNA construct and formulation and dosage to maximise the immune response. The optimised vaccine will be tested for efficacy in a model of infection for MERS, which is a member of the coronavirus family that is in the priority list of viruses with epidemic/pandemic potential.\n\nConserV will collaborate with Phion therapeutics, another UK company that has developed a novel method for nucleic acid delivery creating nanoparticles by interacting with RALA peptide. This technology allows intradermal delivery of nucleic acids offering immunological benefits and also removes the need for ultra-low temperature storage conditions. This makes the vaccine candidate suitable for a global roll-out.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "124281",
    "Abstract": "SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 belong to the genus Betacoronavirus and encode sets of specific accessory proteins. Accessory proteins encoded by coronaviruses are not essential for the viral life cycle but are important regulators that mediate immune evasion for optimal virus replication and propagation. One unique feature of Betacoronavirus that is not seen in other genera of the family Coronaviridae is the presence of a small accessory protein (I) encoded by the +1 open reading frame (ORF) relative to and within the ORF encoding the nucleocapsid (N) gene. The internal (I) proteins of SARS-CoV (ORF9b), MERS-CoV (ORF8b) and SARS-CoV- 2 (ORF9b) have not been extensively characterized. However, in vitro experiments suggest that the I proteins of these viruses have a role in suppressing IFN-I expression, which could potentially contribute to pathogenesis. In this application, we hypothesize that the I protein is a virulence factor with functions specific to each virus. The goal of this project is to study the roles of I proteins in pathogenesis and determine if I proteins possess functions specific to viruses within the genus Betacoronavirus. We generated mutant MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with deletions of I protein expression without altering the coding sequence of the N protein by reverse genetics and found that MERS-CoV lacking I protein expression showed increased virulence in mice, while the absence of the SARS-CoV-2 I protein resulted in attenuation. It is intriguing that the absence of the I protein resulted in such disparate changes in the virulence of the two related CoVs. In Aim 1, we will investigate the virus-specifc functions of the I proteins by inserting the I protein of MERS- and SARS-CoV-2 into mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), another betacoronavirus. In addition, we will interrogate the role of I proteins involved in regulating virus production by interfering with the virus/host machinery required for virus replication. This will be performed by analyzing the I protein interactome by mass spectrometry, detecting the presence of I protein in virions, which would be consistent with a role in virion assembly and release, and comparing the viral life cycle in mutant vs. parental virus-infected mice. In Aim 2, we will assess the role of the I protein in regulating immune responses by comparing mice infected with mutant viruses or parental viruses. We will interrogate the role of IFN-I signaling in the altered virulence of mutant viruses, as I proteins have been shown to suppress IFN-I induction in vitro. In addition, changes in immune responses will be investigated by measuring inflammatory cytokines in the blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and the lungs of mice infected with mutant or parental viruses. Immune profiling of mice infected with mutant viruses will be performed and compared to mice infected with parental viruses by scRNA-seq. The training and experiments proposed in this career development award will not only offer invaluable opportunities for me to acquire new skills and techniques required for developing my own independent research in viral immunology and pathogenesis but also address important questions regarding how specific viral proteins act as virulence factors in coronavirus-infected cells.",

    "Abstract": "Project summary: Here we seek to identify the role of diabetes in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pathogenesis. MERS-CoV emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia leading to over 2200 infections with a ~35% case fatality rate. The majority of lethal MERS-CoV infections are associated with a comorbidity, with diabetes as the top comorbidity. We have found that MERS-CoV pathogenesis is exacerbated in a mouse with pre-existing diabetes. We will determine the mechanism for this enhanced disease by determining the role of the changes in lung architecture, and immune response. In Aim1 we will determine whether accessibility of the Type 2 alveolar cells, the target cells for MERS-CoV in the alveoli, is increased in diabetic mice compared to normal mice. Our data suggests that at the earliest points of infection, the alveoli are highly susceptible to MERS- CoV but normal mouse Type 2 alveolar cells are not. We will evaluate the mucus and architecture of the lungs to determine if there is a difference that could explain the differential infection. In Aim 2, we will determine if the immune response in diabetic mice is different than normal mice. A difference in the immune response, especially innate immune response, could explain the susceptibility differences in diabetic and normal mice. In Aim 3 we will determine whether therapeutics that are effective in normal mice are deficient in diabetic mice with the goal of altering those therapeutics in the future for more effective therapies for comorbid patients. Together this proposal will determine why diabetic mice and potentially humans are highly susceptible to MERS-CoV.",

    "Abstract": "To prepare for the next emerging infection, our goal is to establish a state-of-the-art Emerging Infectious Diseases Research Center with surveillance for the key disease syndromes ? respiratory disease, encephalitis and fever of unknown origin? that have been observed most frequently associated with emerging viruses in the past few decades. In parallel, surveillance of animal and insect vectors will be performed to identify the origins of and define transmissions patterns associated with, these novel emerging viruses. The Center includes four international surveillance sites?China, Hong Kong, Nepal and Ethiopia? which were carefully selected on the basis of having either an established history of viral emergence or high potential to capture such events. China, Hong Kong and Nepal are all situated in Southeast Asia, which has historically been a nidus for many emerging viruses such as H5N1 influenza, SARS Coronavirus, Severe Fever and Thrombocytopenia virus, and the very recently reported Alongshan virus. Ethiopia, along with Northeastern Africa, is at high risk for emergence of MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) due to endemicity of MERS in camels, a key reservoir in the region. To identify novel or emerging viruses, we will use complementary virus family- specific consensus PCR and unbiased next generation sequencing approaches and then sequence their complete genomes. Subsequently, we will generate key reagents essential for establishment of diagnostic assays and the study of fundamental aspects of viral pathogenesis, epidemiology, and immune control. These include development of cell culture systems, targeted RT-PCR/PCR assays, serological assays, monoclonal antibodies for antigen detection and potential therapeutic applications, mouse models of infection, and if appropriate, ferret models of virus transmission. An additional component of the center is international capacity building. Initial efforts focus on two exemplar viruses: MERS-CoV, a recently emerged virus, and a highly variant Dengue virus, Dengue virus 5, which is has prevalence and emergence potential. MERS-CoV is a deadly zoonotic respiratory pathogen with a case fatality rate of ~35% to date. We will implement surveillance for these viruses and develop additional reagents and assays to characterize their epidemiology and pathogenic potential. These efforts will establish and validate the critical infrastructure necessary to respond to a new emerging infectious disease. In the event of a new outbreak, efforts will be reprioritized to focus on response to the new emerging threat. The priorities, in order, are: (1) Human and animal surveillance for novel/emerging viruses; (2) Assay and reagent development; (3) Define epidemiology of novel/emerging viruses; (4) Pathogenesis, immune control, transmission and treatment of novel/emerging viruses.",

    "Abstract": "The magnitude and duration of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have underscored the need to have a well-equipped?and ideally prepositioned?arsenal of antiviral weapons to mount an adequate public health response. A key lesson is that multiple medical countermeasures (MCMs) are needed to maintain potency and efficacy in the face of a rapidly evolving virus. Several approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been paramount to gaining control over the pandemic, reducing both the number of infections and severity of disease for much of the global population. Unfortunately, these vaccines provide little to no protection to immunocompromised individuals who are unable to mount an effective immune response. Half-life extended monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer an attractive alternative, as their long half-life and high potency offer instantaneous immunity and vaccine-like protection without requiring the generation of a robust immune response. While >10,000 mAbs and multiple mAb cocktails have been explored over the course of the pandemic and several advanced as therapeutic candidates, they have largely failed to maintain potent activity in the face of prevalent antigenic drift within the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Moreover, currently approved vaccines and immunotherapeutics offer no protection from a related b-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus. While small molecule inhibitors such as Paxlovid have shown broad in vitro activity against SARS and MERS, significant issues with COVID-19 rebound following treatment suggest it may not remain efficacious against the more lethal MERS virus. A recently identified antibody, 1249A8 (renamed AR-703), that recognizes a unique and highly conserved epitope in the S2 domain of the coronavirus spike protein offers a potential solution, being refractory to antigenic drift and having broad activity b- CoV activity, inclusive of SARS and MERS. The goal of the proposal is to maximize the clinical utility of AR-703 through multidimensional structure-based approach to increase neutralization potency and expand breadth of AR-703. In parallel, bispecific antibody engineering utilizing a novel bovine ultra-long CDR3 (UL-CDR3) based bispecific platform technology will be explored to introduce synergistic neutralization and resist viral escape. The structures of bovine UL-CDR3s have a demonstrated ability to independently target cryptic highly conserved epitopes, vital to maintaining efficacy to novel viral variants. Combining AR-703 and pan-b-CoV UL-CDR3 into a single bispecific would enable dual engagement of highly conserved neutralizing epitopes offering a potent solution to SARS2 antigenic drift for the immunocompromised while also guarding against related lethal b-CoVs should they emerge in the future.\nPublic Health Relevance Statement\nThe public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been severely challenged by the failure of vaccines and therapeutics to keep up with a continuously evolving virus. Here, we will combine a recently identified antibody, AR-703, that recognizes a unique and highly conserved epitope in the betacoronavirus (b-CoV) spike together with multidimensional structure-based antibody engineering to generate a novel single bispecific molecule with enhanced breadth, potency, and robustness to viral escape. We will advance the lead candidate into preclinical development to address the unmet need for an effective b-CoV prophylactic for high-risk groups who fare poorly with current vaccines or are unable to receive them, including the immunocompromised and elderly.",

    "Abstract": "Marburg virus disease is indistinguishable from disease caused by Ebolaviruses and is associated with a high case fatality rate. Marburg virus has caused disease outbreaks predominantly in Eastern and Central Africa, with eleven incidences of outbreaks on record between 1975 and 2021\\. The location of the most recent Marburg virus outbreak has caused concern regarding viral spread into Western Africa as previous outbreaks have been limited to Kenya, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Marburg virus has been identified as a virus of pandemic and epidemic potential.\n\nThere are no clinically available vaccines that can protect against disease caused by Marburg virus. Our vaccine modality of choice, for vaccine manufacture, is a chimpanzee adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1). ChAdOx1 regimens are highly immunogenic, and we have demonstrated they can induce protection against disease (e.g. the Oxford/AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 protects against COVID-19). Of note, the emergency response against COVID-19 has led to large-scale manufacture of this vaccine technology and there is now an accumulated manufacturing experience to generate vaccines at scale and at a price which can be used in low and middle income countries. We have started to generate a vaccine against Marburg virus and in this application we will progress this vaccine through GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) production - generating a vaccine that can be used in humans to protect against viral haemorrhagic disease.",

    "Abstract": "We have developed a pre-clinical trivalent Haemorrhagic Fever Vaccine (HFV) candidate able to combat three important African haemorrhagic fever viruses: Lassa Fever virus (LASV), Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg (MARV) viruses. Separately, a fourth vaccine monovalent candidate against Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) has been developed by our collaborator Miles Carroll is about to start Phase 1 trials. These highly pathogenic RNA viruses cause regular epidemics, and outbreaks cause significant morbidity and mortality with significant impact on human health in low- and middle-income countries (Heeney, J Internal Med, 2006). Lassa fever is endemic to Western Africa with estimates ranging between 300,000 to a million infections, with 5,000 deaths per year. Its overlapping geographic distribution with other Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers (VHFs) caused by Filoviruses such as Ebola virus (EBOV) complicated the early clinical diagnosis of Ebola virus disease in the 2014/2015 West African outbreak.\n\nA combined VHF vaccine eliciting protection against the four major haemorrhagic fevers in West and Central Africa would be of great benefit. Currently there are no licensed vaccines for these infections. A single vaccine to protect against all these regionally important VHFs that is economic, easy to produce, readily deployable and temperature stable in the absence of continuous cold chain storage is highly desirable. The Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine platform is a non-replicating, third generation smallpox vaccine vector and one of the safest, most advanced large antigen payload recombinant pox-based vaccine vectors in human clinical trials (Cottingham & Carroll, Vaccine, 2013). MVA is a robust vector system capable of co-expressing multiple transgenes facilitating potent promoters and stable insertion sites (Orubu et al, PLOSone, 2012). By designing an MVA vector strategy to combining antigens from these 3 pathogens together with CCHF in MVA we aim to cover all 4 major overlapping causes of VHFs in Africa with the inherent protection against Monkeypox afforded by the MVA vaccine vector.\n\nTo develop a pan-Viral Haemorrhagic Fever vaccine covering the 4 major causes of VHF, this VHFvac4 project brings the synergistic new platform technologies together from the CCHF-MVA project (Carroll, Innovate UK with the HFVac3 projects). Using the DIOS synthetic immune optimised vaccine inserts which provide the broadest possible vaccine protection, our trivalent vaccine demonstrated robust proof of concept (PoC) in the Tri-LEMvac consortium. We now take the next bold step to expand this to the 4th major VHF, CCHF as an all in one multivalent pan VHF vaccine for Africa.",

    "Abstract": "RNA vaccine technology has recently come of age, with RNA vaccine products from Pfizer and Moderna, showing the highest efficacy values against COVID-19 in multiple countries. However, both vaccines are the most expensive to come to market and have limited access in low- and middle-income countries. The success of these imported vaccines serves to highlight the lack of RNA vaccine development and manufacturing expertise within the UK. Imperial College has been at the international forefront in the development of a low dose RNA vaccine platform based on novel self-amplifying RNA technology (saRNA). This is delivered by an RNA sequence that both encodes a vaccine target such as the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus and replicase proteins capable of making multiple copies of the RNA sequence following injection into the muscle. This provides significant advantages allowing vaccine doses that are 30-100 times lower than that for conventional RNA vaccines, reducing cost, providing increased safety, and making it easier to generate combined vaccines. While the Imperial team were the first in the world to take this new technology into clinical trials, it is recognised that significant improvements could be made to this unique platform through optimising the manufacturing process. Of note, this first saRNA vaccine had to be manufactured outside of the UK as the required expertise for production were not available in country. We have advanced vaccines through preclinical development against several diseases of epidemic potential identified by the UK Vaccine Network including those against Ebola, Marburg, Rift Valley Fever, Lassa Fever and Plague. These are poised for clinical evaluation. Through this project we will determine the optimal production process to ensure maximal potency, bringing them to a state of readiness for manufacturing to the standards required for clinical assessment. We will apply innovative technology to the design, production, purification, and quality control for our existing vaccines targeted against pathogens with epidemic potential. To achieve our goal, we will work with the Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) delivering a clinical grade process by the end of the project. This project builds on existing UK investment in this emerging technology that will generate matchless knowhow and expertise in manufacturing of saRNA vaccines. The proposed work will help to realise the full potential of a unique vaccine platform providing the UK with national pandemic resilience while advancing vaccine candidates that could be deployed against outbreak pathogens in low- and middle-income countries.",

    "Abstract": "The ebolaviruses (EBOV, SUDV, BDBV) and marburgviruses (MARV and RAVV), cause periodic outbreaks of severe viral hemorrhagic fever with very high mortality rates. The 2013-2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa highlighted the serious nature of a filovirus epidemic and its regional and global implications. This outbreak took an enormous toll on people at the front line of the epidemic control, i.e., physicians, nurses, hospital personnel, social workers, and other support staff. Many nurses and physicians lost their lives helping patients and many left their profession out of fear of exposure. The near breakdown of the local healthcare system further fueled the spread of the virus across the region. Therefore, protection of the first responders must be a high priority and is critical for successful outbreak control. Currently, while a prophylactic vaccine is available for EVD, there are no therapeutic or prophylactic countermeasures available for Marburg virus disease (MVD) which has led to many outbreaks and as recently as June 2022. The objective of this proposal is to develop an effective immunoprophylactic for protection of first responders against MVD. Such a product mut be 1) extremely potent to enable economically affordable low dose levels, and 2) have extended bioavailability to provide a reasonably long duration of protection. We and others have isolated several classes of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for ebolaviruses. However, for marburgviruses only a single class of mAbs against the glycoprotein (GP) has been described that all target a single epitope within the receptor binding site (RBS) of MARV and RAVV GP. Now, using a novel immunization and B cell selection approach with rationally designed antigens we have succeeded in identifying a new class of mAbs that bind to a novel epitope and neutralize marburgviruses at sub- to low-nM concentrations and are up to 100-fold more potent than the RBS binders. A lead antibody, R217, has been selected and shown to protect against MVD in mice, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates (NHPs). In this SBIR project we propose to engineer the Fc portion of this macaque-human chimeric antibody by introducing mutations (YTE) in the FcRn binding region to extend the half-life of the antibody and evaluate the efficacy of the product. In Aim 1 R217-YTE will be produced in ExpiCHO cells and fully characterized. Pharmacokinetics (PK) will be evaluated in NHPs. In Aim 2, the efficacy of R217-YTE against MVD will be evaluated in the settings of pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis and the required dose level and serum neutralization activity required for protection will be determined. Aim 3 will be focused on generation of a stable manufacturing cell line in CHO cells and a research cell bank to be used for production of future GMP cell banks. If successful, we anticipate further development of the product under DoD or BARDA funding and approval under FDA Animal Rule.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "230538",
    "Abstract": "Summary This developmental project seeks to develop methods to dramatically boost immunogenicity of virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines. Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) are members of the filovirus family of enveloped, negative-sense RNA viruses that causes outbreaks of severe human disease. Due to their lethality, filoviruses are among the handful of emerging viruses for which biosafety level 4 (BSL4) containment is required for their study. Although progress has been made toward EBOV vaccines, there remains a need for development of vaccines for other filoviruses, particularly MARV. VLPs are an often-explored vaccine platform for a variety of viruses, including for EBOV and MARV. Advantages of VLPs include their relative safety, as they cannot replicate and cause viral disease; their close resemblance to authentic virus, such that they present antigens in their native state; their capacity to elicit both B and T cell responses and their proven efficacy for a variety of systems. Potential challenges of VLPs as vaccines include relatively lower immunogenicity, as compared to live virus. Filovirus VLPs can be produced by co-expression of the viral matrix protein VP40, the viral glycoprotein (GP), with or without expression of the viral nucleoprotein (NP). Such VLPs have been demonstrated to stimulate dendritic cell (DC) responses, to elicit B and T cell mediated immunity and to protect mice, guinea pigs and non- human primates (NHPs) from lethal challenge. Therefore, filovirus VLPs are viable vaccine candidates. However, filovirus VLP immunogenicity is weak with protection requiring coadministration with an adjuvant and multiple doses. This is not ideal for vaccines that are mainly deployed in response to outbreaks. This application seeks to dramatically improve immunogenicity of EBOV and MARV VLPs by the rational incorporation of type I interferon (IFN) signaling domains from the cellular pattern recognition receptors RIG-I or TRIF into the particles. This enables delivery into cells of the IFN inducing domain by the VLPs, triggering robust innate immune responses reminiscent of live virus infection, to boost adaptive immune responses. To further pursue this direction, we will explore approaches to optimize the incorporation of IFN-inducing signaling domains into EBOV and MARV VLPs. We will then evaluate the capacity of the different enhanced VLP strategies to elicit B and T cell immune responses in vivo, and finally, test the most promising enhanced VLPs for the capacity to elicit rapid protection against EBOV and MARV challenge in mice. Successful completion of these studies will provide a novel platform for the development of filovirus vaccines and an approach that can likely be applied to other emerging viral pathogens.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "407579",
    "Abstract": "The filoviruses Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) are negative-sense RNA viral pathogens that cause periodic outbreaks of severe disease in humans. Despite their importance as emerging pathogens and as public health threats, many aspects of filovirus biology remain understudied. One major knowledge gap concerns the function(s) of the non-protein coding sequences present in filovirus genomes that correspond to 5? and 3? untranslated regions (UTRs) in viral mRNAs. These sequences comprise ~22% of the MARV genome and a similar amount of the EBOV genome and yet have been barely studied. Another knowledge gap concerns mechanisms by which viral mRNAs are translated to protein and how this may be sustained when innate immune responses are activated. Beginning to address this, we previously demonstrated a role for an upstream open reading frame (uORF), present in the 5?UTR of the EBOV L open reading frame (ORF), in the regulation of L translation. We further implicated this uORF as providing a means to sustain L expression under conditions innate antiviral defenses are activated. These data support a role for the UTRs as translational regulators which can modulate viral gene expression in the face of innate antiviral defenses. Our recent profiling of MARV 3?UTR function suggests negative-regulatory elements are present in the nucleoprotein (NP) mRNA and that positive regulatory elements are present in the L mRNA. In addition, we previously reported that the MARV genome appears to be edited by adenosine deaminase activity, particularly in sequences corresponding to the nucleoprotein (NP) mRNA 3?UTR. We now show that such mutations substantially increase mRNA translation efficiency, suggesting a means to maintain NP expression when the IFN-induced p150 form of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is upregulated. Interestingly, the regulatory elements within the wildtype NP 3?UTR are also capable of triggering innate immune responses, but this immune stimulating activity is alleviated by the presumptive ADAR1 editing mutations. To follow up on these observations, we propose a combination of transfection- and live virus-based experiments to define the translation regulatory elements in MARV and EBOV 3? UTRs and to determine how ADAR1 editing impacts viral gene expression and virus replication. We will fully evaluate the capacity of MARV and EBOV 5? and 3?UTRs to trigger innate antiviral responses, defining the sensors responsible for this induction. Finally, we will create recombinant MARVs with wildtype and mutant 3?UTR sequences. These will be tested in wildtype and ADAR1-deficient cells and mice in order to determine how translational regulatory elements and ADAR1 editing impact viral growth and pathogenesis. Cumulatively, these studies will provide significant new insight into filovirus-host interactions related to translation and innate immune evasion.",

    "Abstract": "Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic pathogen, with the animal reservoir primarily being fruit bats. Outbreaks occur almost annually in parts of Asia, with human infection associated with encephalitis which can result in death. Due to regular spillover events into humans and ability for person-to-person transmission, NiV poses a public health risk. As such, the UK Vaccine Network (UKVN) list it as a priority pathogen for investment in vaccine development and it is on the list of priority diseases for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). This has helped to accelerate the development of vaccines against NiV.Whilst immunogenicity studies can help to ascertain induced immunity, unfortunately no correlate of protection exists for NiV. Therefore, there is no current substitute for assessing vaccine efficacy without the use of animal models. With NiV being a hazard group 4 pathogen, work with live virus is restricted to containment level 4 facilities such as those available at UKHSA, Porton.\n\nThis proposal is to establish the hamster model of NiV within the UK. This model will provide a useful resource for the preclinical advancement of vaccines, including the prioritisation of vaccine candidates and optimisation of immunisation schedules. Given the recent substantial investment to NiV vaccines, there is a strong pipeline of candidates being developed for which this model can be utilised to evaluate efficacy.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "332404",
    "Abstract": "Pig-to-human transmission was responsible for the first and most severe Nipah virus (NiV) outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998-99\\. This outbreak was controlled by culling almost half of all pigs in Malaysia, which caused severe and lasting economic damage to the local pig industry. Despite the threat NiV poses to some of the most pig dense regions of the world, no vaccines are currently available. Commercial development of NiV vaccines is limited, since animal health companies are of the opinion that there will be limited marketability due to the sporadic nature of spillover outbreaks. To address this gap, we are developing a vaccine for use in pigs that would reduce the risk that NiV poses to the pig industry, livestock keepers and public health. We have demonstrated that immunisation of pigs with either the NiV G or F glycoproteins, using a two-shot immunisation regime, provides a high level of protection against NiV. However, the protection is lost when pigs are challenged after a single immunisation. A NiV vaccine for pigs could be deployed in response to an emergency outbreak situation or routinely used to reduce the risk of NiV outbreaks occurring. The proposed project aims to address the requirements for both scenarios by evaluating a vaccine candidate that may provide rapid immunity after a single immunisation and could also be used as a bivalent vaccine. Live attenuated pseudorabies virus (PrV) vaccines are highly effective vaccines that have enabled the eradication of PrV from large parts of Europe and America. Live attenuated PrV can be readily engineered to express antigens from other pathogens and serve as potent vaccine vectors. This project will evaluate whether live attenuated PrV expressing both NiV G and F can elicit protective immune responses after a single immunisation. If successful, this vaccine could also be exploited as a bivalent vaccine. Since pigs in the NiV endemic region are routinely vaccinated with live attenuated PrV vaccines, this could present an economically viable approach to mass immunisation, which would significantly reduce the risk of NiV outbreaks emerging through pigs. Approvals for both preventative and reactive use NiV vaccines will be reliant on the availability of diagnostic tests that are able to discriminate infected from vaccinated animals. We will therefore evaluate the potential of recombinant NiV nucleocapsid, phosphoprotein, and matrix proteins to detect antibodies in infected but not vaccinated pigs.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "Unspecified",
    "Abstract": "RNA viruses, such as paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses, continually evolve in response to external stimuli such as antibody selection pressure. This evolution is aided by the high error rates of the viral RNA polymerases of these viruses. Error prone replication, rapid replication and large epidemics/pandemics also contribute to the general accumulation of many synonymous nucleotide changes in the genome and non-synonymous protein changes with neutral effects on phenotype. Discriminating between phenotypically relevant amino acid changes and those that are non-functional is vital, especially in identifying mutations that could confer infection in new hosts, and for the design and application of vaccines. Within this project we will examine how variation in the viral glycoproteins (vGP) of two important groups of viruses, beta-coronaviruses and Henipaviruses affects their neutralisation by established and/or experimental vaccines. Focusing on the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic we will investigate whether existing vaccines can provide robust immunity to emerging/established variants. On a broader scale, we will examine the breadth of immunity offered by Henipavirus-based vaccines and whether neutralising antibody responses to these vaccines are capable of neutralising different species within the same genera. Building on these results we will characterise the epitopes involved to define the molecular mechanisms underpinning this neutralisation, building a detailed understanding of intra-species and inter-species protection. These data will inform vaccine design to protect livestock from future known or unknown Henipavirus outbreaks and to prevent onward transmission to humans.\n\nBBSRC priority areas: This research will address the BBSRC priority areas of animal health, collaborative research and research that informs public policy. As part of the Genotype to Phenotype UK (G2P-UK) Consortium, we will investigate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 variants and related beta-coronaviruses to infect mammalian hosts that could act as reservoirs for sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission in human and animal populations. We will also assess the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines against emerging or established variants in collaboration with G2P-UK and Public Health England (PHE), with the aim of informing public health strategies. In addition, Henipaviruses have been shown to cross the species barrier and cause pathology in humans and animals, both naturally and experimentally. In particular, Nipah virus, has been identified by the World Health Organisation as a priority zoonotic pathogen that requires research and development. We therefore propose to develop a cross-protective vaccine that could prevent future outbreaks and sustained transmission of Henipaviruses (known or unknown) that pose a major threat to agriculture, livestock and public health.",

    "GrantTitleEng": "Developing broad-spectrum antivirals as a rapid response option for future global epidemics",
    "GrantAmountConverted": "713027",
    "Abstract": "Every year the world health organisation (WHO) assembles a list of priority diseases that require urgent research and development. Each year this list is almost exclusively populated with some of the worlds deadliest viral infections, with each posing a significant public health risk due to their epidemic potential and their total (or insufficient) lack of counter measures. The list includes viruses such as Ebola, Crimean Congo Fever, Lassa Virus and Zika virus. Developing countermeasures against these viruses is extremely challenging and often tackled only one virus at a time. Developing virus specific counter measures is ultimately a short lived strategy as viruses rapidly mutate leading to resistant viral strains or ineffective vaccines.\n\nAs has become abundantly clear in recent months, our rapid global response to viral outbreaks is virtually non-existent resulting in unnecessary loss of life. When new viral infections are identified it takes too long to develop vaccines, virus specific antiviral drugs and detection systems and when they are eventually developed they are unable to be used for future outbreaks. This delay in development allows the infection to spread globally with potential for large numbers of deaths (even with relatively mild infections) and huge impact on the global economy.\n\nIf broad-spectrum antiviral drugs existed, equivalent to broad-spectrum antibiotics, viral infections could be contained quickly and/or their spread delayed to give researchers, policy makers and governments the much needed time to deploy other counter measures. Sadly however, no such broad-spectrum antivirals exist and our only current option is to deploy social measures such as closing boarders and self-isolation, which all have significant impacts on the economy.\n\nBuilding on our experience in developing broad-spectrum antiviral nano- and sugar-based materials, we propose to use polymers to create broad-spectrum virucides (Polycides). These polycides would hold some significant advantages over both current and proposed methods of dealing with viral outbreaks. These broad-spectrum polycides would be stable for long periods of time so easily stored, easily deployed and cost effective to produce. These materials could be deployed around the globe, before a viral outbreak occurs, ready for use at the first signs of newly emerging viral outbreaks. Drastically altering our response to outbreaks from reactive to proactive.\n\nWe have produced generation 1 polymers to test our hypothesis which we have shown is not only possible but that our unoptimised materials are >5000 times more effective than any of our previous (optimised) broad-spectrum antivirals. They are also quicker to produce at larger scales (grams in hours rather than milli-grams in weeks) and use cheaper starting materials. It is of paramount importance that we explore further these extremely exciting results and look to develop a greater understanding and how these materials work.\n\nHere we will design, synthesise and then conduct antiviral testing on a range of homo- and block co-polymers, using our preliminary results as a starting point. Through an iterative approach, we aim to identify not only the most potent broad-spectrum antivirals but to investigate their mechanism so as to determine their mode of action and inform the design of future iterations. By partnering with Public Health England these antivirals will be tested against several of the viruses on the WHOs priority diseases list, including Ebola, and surrogate viruses for Lassa fever, Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever and Nipah Virus.\n\nBy the end of this study non-toxic virucidal polymers will have been identified and for the first time a material with broad-spectrum efficacy against some of the worlds most deadly viruses will have been identified. This will lead the way for further studies and funding to develop these antivirals into a much needed antiviral treatment of the future",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "848745",
    "Abstract": "Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) cause a significant portion of childhood croup, bronchiolitis and pneumonia in the U.S. and worldwide, yet no effective drugs or vaccines are available. For the lethal Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses, in the face of human-to-human transmission of NiV, there is risk for global spread as well as accidental or deliberate exposure. Despite the existence of antibody preparations for passive immunoprophylaxis, there is no feasible approach to prevent or treat the human disease. These viruses serve as prototypes for emerging paramyxoviruses. With this application we build on recent breakthroughs that have led to a new broad-spectrum antiviral strategy based on inhibiting fusion during viral entry. We combine structure-based optimization of fusion inhibitory lipopeptides, backbone modification via partial replacement of ?-amino acid residues with unnatural ?-amino acid residues to enhance half-life, and addition of lipid components to enhance antiviral efficacy. Using virologic, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments we will develop powerful novel HPIV3/NiV/HeV fusion inhibitors that can be administered by inhalation. Validation of our strategies with circulating respiratory viruses and clinical NiV virus strains in vitro and in vivo will lead us to antiviral agents that are effective and practical in the clinical setting. Aim 1. Targeting the paramyxovirus fusion complex: Evaluate entry inhibitor approaches in vitro. We will develop fusion-inhibitory lipopeptides, combining conventional peptide design with backbone- modification and membrane targeting to optimize broad fusion inhibition activity for NiV, HeV, HPIV, and optimize potency, protease resistance, and tissue targeting of lead lipopeptides. We will evaluate antiviral activity and potential for antiviral resistance in authentic ex vivo models. Human airway and brain models will be employed to elicit resistant viruses in ex vivo evolution experiments, to study the molecular bases for antiviral activity and potential for resistance to lead peptides. Aim 2. Pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and efficacy of formulated lead antivirals in vivo. We will assess the biodistribution and immunogenicity, acute toxicity, and PK/PD via nasal or inhalation delivery of lead candidate series in small animal models, and evaluate efficacy of lead peptides for NiV/HeV in golden hamsters and for HPIV in cotton rats. An efficacy study for the NiV lead will be conducted in African green monkeys. We propose that peptide backbone modification and membrane targeting strategies will generate broad anti- paramyxovirus agents that can be delivered via inhalation with unprecedented efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "691098",
    "Abstract": "Until and unless we better understand and prevent spillovers of bat-borne viruses into intermediate hosts and humans, we will be severely limited in our ability to stop pandemics. Henipaviruses are bat-borne, RNA viruses that spillover through this route. Nearly half of all reported human henipavirus infections have been associated with contact with sick domesticated animals, though our understanding of drivers of henipavirus spillovers and specific transmission pathways remains severely limited. Building on preliminary data about bat, domesticated animal and human infections, this multidisciplinary study integrates epidemiology, ecology, and anthropology to identify spillover pathways for henipaviruses into domesticated animals in Bangladesh and the risk they pose to human health. Our first aim is to identify drivers of henipavirus spillovers into domesticated animals in Faridpur, Bangladesh. We will use multiplex pan-henipavirus assays to identify infections in Pteropus medius bats and domesticated animals living nearby this roost through cross-sectional and prospective studies. Combined with intensive studies of bat-domesticated animal interactions and weather data, we will build statistical models to identify the relative contribution of each of these factors. Our second aim is to describe which henipaviruses are being transmitted from bats to domesticated animals. Serologic studies of animals in Bangladesh show that they are frequently infected with non-Nipah henipaviruses. Through surveillance for and sampling of sick domesticated animals, we will describe the specific viruses that spillover from bats in Faridpur. Our third aim is to determine the risk of henipavirus transmission from domesticated animals to humans. We hypothesize that undetected henipavirus spillovers in humans are occurring through contact with sick domesticated animals and will conduct cross-sectional and prospective serosurveys of humans who have close contact with sick animals in Faridpur. We remain ignorant about henipavirus spillovers through intermediate hosts ? including the specific viruses spilling over, the frequency and distribution of spillovers, and the pathways of transmission ? at our own peril. The knowledge gained from this study will be immediately applicable to human and animal health programs in Bangladesh and other countries where henipaviruses circulate in bats. By learning about which henipaviruses infect humans, and how they are infected, we can advise public health surveillance programs on how to optimize detection and epidemiologic investigation of cases across Bangladesh. Our investigations about spillovers in Faridpur can also be scaled- up to other areas of Bangladesh and countries where henipaviruses circulate in bats so that we can truly begin to appreciate the scale of henipavirus spillovers in the global landscape.\nPublic Health Relevance Statement\nProject Narrative We remain ignorant about bat henipavirus spillovers through intermediate hosts ? including the specific viruses spilling over, the frequency and distribution of spillovers, and the pathways of transmission ? at our own peril. Until and unless we better understand and prevent spillovers of bat-borne viruses into intermediate hosts and humans, we will be severely limited in our ability to stop pandemics. The knowledge gained from this study will be immediately applicable to human and animal health programs because if we know which henipaviruses infect humans and domesticated animals, and how they are infected, we can advise public health surveillance programs on how to optimize detection and prevention of infections.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "597757",
    "Abstract": "Henipavirus (HNV) genus, named after the first two identified members, Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV), is a group of expanding zoonotic viruses that have caused repeated outbreaks with case fatality rate reaching 75%. The exceptional broad species tropism and various transmission routes make HNV a risk of potential future pandemics. Both HeV and NiV have been categorized as Biological Safety Level-4 (BSL-4) transboundary agents, and NIAID Category C Priority Pathogens. There are six emerging HNVs reported in recent years, showing limited antigenic cross-reactivity with NiV and HeV. Glycoproteins F and G are the two only spikes on the HNV surface, which coordinate the viral entry process via G glycoprotein-mediated receptor attachment followed by the F glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion between virus and host cell. Both G and F proteins are the targets of HNV-neutralizing antibodies. Vaccine and monoclonal antibody (mAb) countermeasure development focusing on these two HNV glycoproteins are now of critical and urgent importance to prepare for potential HNV spillover events. The ectodomain of HNV G glycoprotein is a homo- tetramer with each protomer composed of a globular head and a stalk region. The metastable tetrameric conformation has restricted the previous structural characterization of G protein to the monomeric head only, which is a major obstacle for a comprehensive understanding of the G protein-mediated mechanisms of HNV entry and antibody recognition. HNV F glycoprotein trimer transits from the prefusion to the post-fusion conformation during viral entry process. The metastable prefusion conformation can be preferably recognized by neutralizing antibodies, whereby a promising target for vaccine design and therapeutic development. While the glycoproteins of both HeV and NiV have been extensively studied, the glycoproteins of the emerging HNVs, which are genetically and antigenically distinct from the two prototypic HNVs, also extremely diverse among themselves, have not been well investigated. We have used rational designs to created soluble, stabilized, oligomeric glycoprotein ectodomain constructs from several emerging HNVs, including two phylogenically distant bat-borne HNVs, CedPV and AngV, to facilitate structural, functional and antigenicity characterization. We propose to use structural and structure-based functional analyses of these glycoproteins to assist delineation of the function of HNV glycoprotein-mediated entry. We will also define the antigenicity of these HNV glycoproteins with neutralizing antibodies, including conventional murine antibodies and camelid single-domain antibodies, to investigate their neutralization epitopes and mechanisms structurally and functionally. The combined antigenicity results will render a comprehensive definition of sites of vulnerability on both G and F glycoproteins of the emerging HNVs. Collectively, findings derived from this project will provide insights to HNV entry mechanism, as well as inform future work on designing envelope glycoprotein-based vaccine and immunotherapeutic against emerging HNVs.",

Antiviral therapy is urgently needed for henipaviruses for pandemic preparedness. We will achieve the goal by pursuing three aims. (i) Screen and identify novel compounds for Nipah and/or Hendra virus inhibition. Since Nipah and Hendra viruses should be handled at BSL4, it is challenging to perform high-throughput screen at high containment. To overcome this bottleneck, we will use a BSL2 Cedar henipavirus as a surrogate system for antiviral screen. Hits identified from the Cedar henipavirus assay will be validated in Hendra and Nipah viruses at the BSL4 facility. (ii) Develop tool compounds, determine target protein, and optimize molecules. (iii) Evaluate lead compounds in relevant in vitro and in vivo models and select Development Candidate for IND-enabling studies. The proposed cell-based approach may discover novel antiviral targets that may not be tractable for target-based antiviral approach.",

    "Abstract": "Nipah virus (NiV) causes febrile encephalitis and severe respiratory disease in humans with fatality rates as high as 100% in some outbreaks (average ~ 75% for outbreaks over the last decade). There are currently no licensed vaccines or therapies for combating NiV disease. NiV is classified as a Biosafety Level (BSL)-4 pathogen because of the high mortality rates associated with infection, the lack of effective medical countermeasures, and the ease of transmission. In addition to causing morbidity and mortality as a naturally acquired infection, NiV is also categorized as a Category C priority pathogen by several US Government agencies because of the concern for deliberate misuse. Importantly, NiV was recently included on the World Health Organization?s (WHO) 2018 List of Priority Pathogens. As a result of the unprecedented global pandemic of COVID-19 there is heightened concern and awareness regarding respiratory pathogens. Consequently, in March of 2020 the US CDC recommended that NiV be added to the list of Tier 1 Select Agents. Studies to develop effective countermeasures have been hampered by the highly pathogenic nature of NiV and its restriction to BSL-4 containment. An effective prophylactic vaccine would find application with medical personnel and close contacts during outbreaks and with laboratory workers engaged in research. A vaccine based on recombinant G protein deleted (?G) vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV?G) pseudotyped with the glycoproteins (GP) of a number of high consequence viruses have been shown to completely protect nonhuman primates (NHP) against Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa viruses. In addition, the effectiveness of a rVSV-vectored vaccine in preventing Ebola virus disease was demonstrated in a ring vaccination, open-label, cluster-randomised trial in Guinea during the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic. This vaccine was recently licensed as ERVEBO by the European Union and US FDA. Recently, we developed replication-restricted rVSV NiV vaccine vectors expressing the NiV glycoproteins. Importantly, we showed that these vaccines can completely protect NHPs against high dose lethal NiV Bangladesh strain challenge when used as single injection vaccines. This new data is critically important in the context of containing outbreaks as the most effective vaccine in containing a respiratory pathogen and preventing a pandemic is a vaccine that works rapidly with a single administration. Development of a replication restricted platform that provides improved safety without compromising efficacy is a highly significant advancement and can be applied to other viruses with pandemic potential. The main objective of this proposal is to develop a rVSV-based vaccine against NiV (rVSV-NiVBG) that can provide both rapid protection and long term immunity against the most prevalent and pathogenic Bangladesh strain of NiV and to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict protection. In regard to product development, work will also be done to generate research cell bank (RCB) and viral vaccine bank (RVB), a manufacturing process, and conduct of GLP-safety toxicology.",

    "Abstract": "The natural world is expected to undergo a significant change over the coming century, driven by climate change, habitat loss, human population increases and increased globalisation. Many animal-borne or zoonotic human diseases (e.g. Ebola, Plague, Anthrax) are caught from wild animal species and these host species will likely alter what they do and where they are found in response to global changes. The recent emergence of several zoonotic diseases has caused significant social and economic disruption (e.g. SARS-COV-2, Zika, Ebola). One such disease is Lassa Fever, which is found throughout West Africa and has yearly annual widespread outbreaks causing hundreds of deaths a year. It is caught from the widespread, agricultural pest species Mastomys natalensis, also called the Multimammate Rat. Recent evidence has pointed to an increase in cases and, therefore, it is vital we act now to better understand this disease. In this context, working closely with anthropologists, we will create a comprehensive model of the transmission of Lassa Fever virus between the animal hosts and human populations. Using a modelling approach that examines individual rodent and human behaviour, we will look to understand how the seasonal, geographical and sociocultural differences to the conditions that host species experience, alter their chances of transmitting their pathogens to humans. We will also include specific differences in the behaviours of groups of people, such as farm labourers and household workers. From these models, will make and test management recommendations that disrupt contact between people and the host species. We will then use other, simpler methods to summarise the outputs of these complex models. This will allow us to understand more about what we need to know about diseases, to model them across different spatial scales. For instance, to predict the number of cases within a village we would likely need to know lots of information about individual human and rodent behaviour, but to predict the same information at, for instance, a district level we might just need to know how often people and infected rodents meet each other. Uncovering the relationship between drivers of disease risk and spatial scale, would allow us to more easily make risk maps for policy makers that we know are accurate. Overall, using our different approaches we can help predict which areas of West Africa are at risk of Lassa Fever and many other poorly-known animal-borne diseases. By incorporating local-scale processes we can better create measures that prevent disease, while reducing negative impacts on the livelihoods of poor and vulnerable human communities. Furthermore, with large ongoing changes to demography and the environment expected in West Africa over the coming decades, it is important to predict how zoonotic diseases will likely respond to environmental change, to better understand where these diseases may spread in the future. Lastly, we will create two software tools. The first will bring together researchers from different subjects to work more effectively, by providing a bespoke, digital framework for use in participatory mapping. The second, will provide an online framework for untrained users to run our broad-scale disease risk models.\n",

    "Abstract": "Lassa fever (LF), a severe viral disease endemic in West African countries including Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone with approximately 300,000 LF cases and 5,000-10,000 deaths annually. However, these numbers are likely severely underestimated because of limited disease surveillance. Unprecedented recent large outbreaks in Nigeria further highlight the urgency to develop Lassa virus (LASV) vaccines. Currently, a partner consortium, led by IAVI, is advancing a Lassa vaccine candidate (rVSVdG-LASV-GPC) based on the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) platform technology through Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) support. This rVSV-based LASV vaccine has a strong probability of technical feasibility, safety and success in preventing LF. The vaccine candidate demonstrated 100% efficacy in a non-human primate challenge study. Furthermore, it uses the same technology as Merckƒ??s ERVEBO¶© vaccine that has been shown to be safe and efficacious in preventing Ebola virus disease and was licensed by the European Medicines Agency and Food and Drug Administration and prequalified by the WHO. This vaccine has been administered to over 300,000 people, induces protective immunity rapidly with a single dose and can be readily manufactured at large scale.The Lassa Fever Vaccine Efficacy and Prevention for West Africa (LEAP4WA) project, in accordance with the EDCTP2 research agenda goals, will accelerate further development of this rVSVdG-LASV-GPC vaccine through the conduct of an innovative safety and efficacy phase 2b trial that will enroll adults and children from communities in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. This endpoint-driven trial design includes an adaptive element that allows trial size to increase if necessary, to accrue sufficient cases for a definitive result, following an interim look by an independent Data Monitoring Committee. This project will bring together 9 collaborators from Africa, Europe and the United States to facilitate the preparation of investigational sites in outbreak countries, including Nigeria to allow assessment of vaccine cross-protection. LEAP4WA will also strengthen clinical research capacity in West Africa by building partnerships in countries most impacted by LF and across networks of excellence for LF research and vaccine development. The partner consortium will utilize their collective experience to enhance capacity of a network of clinical research centres capable of conducting EID vaccine trials. This effort is expected to significantly advance the development of a LF vaccine portfolio and provide important proof of concept data that will contribute directly to product licensure and ultimately access to much needed LASV vaccines.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "636478",
    "Abstract": "The importance of cell-intrinsic or host restriction factors of the innate immune response in shaping the life cycle of arenaviruses, which pose a significant global disease burden, is poorly understood. I discovered the cell-intrinsic inhibitory activity of the zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24 against arenavirus entry and identified that interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) co-operatively enhance ZMPSTE24-mediated viral restriction. Their expression affects cellular endocytosis kinetics implying a virus invasion barrier mechanism, and that membrane structure perturbation impacts on their activity, highlighting the importance of membrane integrity for arenavirus fusion. This proposal will define the restriction mechanism of ZMPSTE24 and IFITMs and determine their role in arenavirus infection dynamics: Objective 1 will determine their effects on host membrane structure and dynamics by measuring in-cell restriction factor-imposed differences in the freedom of motion of membranes by site-directed spin labelling coupled to Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Heterogeneity in cell lipid order will also be monitored by two-photon emission and confocal with spectral emission microscopy using the membrane probe, NR12S. Objective 2 will elucidate whether arenavirus matrix protein Z, which interacts with ZMPSTE24, has a direct role in antagonising ZMPSTE24 activity, informed by mutagenesis and virus budding assays; thereby highlighting an immune escape strategy. Objective 3 will reveal how ZMPSTE24 restriction impacts on the life cycle of arenaviruses: quantitative proteomics will measure viral and host protein changes at different infection stages in the presence of ZMPSTE24 and IFITMs and identify key processes modulated by these restriction factors. Altogether, this multidisciplinary approach will unravel the impact of host restriction mechanisms on arenavirus pathogenesis and open up avenues for targeted therapeutic strategies.",

    "Abstract": "We know little about how future climate change, habitat destruction, human population increases and greater globalisation processes will impact human zoonotic diseases. Here, I investigate the use of dynamic, seasonal host population models to better predict the impact of real-time environmental change on disease-carrying host species, within a general systems-dynamics, disease framework. Specifically, I will combine a mathematical compartmental disease model with a host population ecology model, within a spatial and temporal Bayesian framework. Using this approach, I will first model Lassa Fever using climate and land-use observations, collaborating with the Nigerian government. I will then augment my model to account for animal movement patterns and vector species abundances, to examine arboviral disease spread in North America. Then, I will integrate these threads into a general, dynamic modelling framework for zoonotic diseases, which will contain both the newly developed components and my previously developed model of human movement and behaviour. Working with the World Health Organisation, I will create short- and long-term disease forecasts for a set of high priority zoonoses. Once validated against human case data, these mechanistic models can be used to test interventions and create future disease management plans that are robust to upcoming global change.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "Unspecified",
    "Abstract": "Lassa fever (LF) is a deadly viral haemorrhagic fever endemic to West Africa. Nigeria has experienced outbreaks of increasing severity, despite growing prevention and response efforts deployed by national and international actors. This disconnect between increased health systems and scientific activity alongside an increasing disease burden requires a close examination of how strategies and programmatic actions are designed and implemented, how on-the-ground realities are addressed, how strategies are informed by epidemiological knowledge, and how policymakers navigate between national and global agenda priorities. This study will draw on health systems research and epidemiological research in addition to anthropological approaches, to examine how health system actors organise LF response strategies in Nigeria. I will conduct a multilevel ethnography at the interfaces of different 'levels' of the health system (the policymaking 'level' and the healthcare delivery 'level') in hotspots of previous LF outbreaks. Through a stakeholder analysis of the actors involved in LF response, in-depth interviews, and participant observation in the policymaking and healthcare delivery spheres, this study will contribute to improved understanding of LF responses in Nigeria and will help identify obstacles from design to implementation. Findings will be applicable to other emerging infectious diseases and will contribute to improved understanding of how health systems respond to outbreaks (such as SARS-Cov-2). Moreover, this study will provide insights into how the production of epidemiological knowledge and the organisation of a health system influence one another. From a methodological perspective, this innovative study will promote the use of interdisciplinary approaches in health systems research.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "396959",
    "Abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases pose a significant risk to human health.Among emerging pathogens, hemorrhagic fever viruses (HFVs) pose the greatest risk in terms of thepotential for morbidity and mortality. These viruses are endemic in remote regions, produce large outbreaks that display high mortality rates, and have a high potential become pandemics. One of the largest families of HFVs is the Arenaviruses, which includes 6 DHHS select agents. The most well-known of these,\nLassa\nvirus, has caused an increasing number of infections in recent years, includinga 2018 outbreak in Nigeria that led to over 100 deaths. In 2017, the World health Organizationdesignated\nLassa\nvirus as a priority pathogen for R&D efforts due to its potential to generate a publichealth emergency. Other hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses, including Lujo, Chapare, Guanarito, Junin,and Machupo represent an increasing source of concern based on their increased distribution and recent instances of human-to-human transmission. Current diagnostic capabilities for\nLassa\nvirusand other arenaviruses are extremely limited, especially in the case of point-of-care (POC) diagnosticassays. Here, we propose to develop a POC diagnostic assay with the sensitivity and breadth ofcoverage required to diagnose\nLassa\nvirus infections currently present in West Africa. In addition, wewill generate single chain antibody phage display libraries, broadly reactive high affi nity diagnosticantibody pairs, a prototype assay chips for the 5 other arenaviruses that are Category A PriorityPathogens. We have previously used these procedures to develop a POC diagnostic assay for Ebolavirus that displays a sensitivity better than the current gold standard, PCR. The successfulcompletion of these studies will result in the fi rst POC diagnostic assay that is capable of detectingall\nLassa\nstrains of clinical importance and a panel of high affi nity diagnostic Abs and assays for allCategory A Arenaviruses. In addition, the broadly reactive single chain antibody libraries we producecould be used to rapidly generate diagnostic antibodies against novel arenaviruses that arise aszoonotic outbreaks. This work will thus signifi cantly improve our preparedness for almost any futuremajor Arenavirus outbreak with pandemic potential.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "417631",
    "Abstract": "Pathogenic Old and New World arenaviruses cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans. There arecurrently no approved vaccines or drugs to battle arenavirus infection. Despite intensive studies,arenavirus entry pathways into host cells and the mechanism of arenavirus glycoprotein (GP)mediated virus-cell fusion are not well understood. Old World and New World arenaviruses usedistinct cellular receptors and poorly characterized endocytic pathways to enter and infect cells.Based on our preliminary data and published work, we propose a novel overarching hypothesis thatOld and New World arenaviruses use common post-uptake pathways to enter a subset of lateendosomes that contain a specifi c lipid cofactor, LBPA, but lack the host restriction factor IFITM3.We found that fusion of diverse arenaviruses is promoted by LBPA and that the\nLassa\nvirus bypassesendosomes enriched in IFITM3, thereby escaping restriction. We also found that GP-mediated fusionrequires thiol-disulfi de interchange within this glycoprotein and obtained evidence that GP mediatesarenavirus membrane permeabilization prior to fusion with acidic endosomes, which wehypothesized promotes subsequent virus uncoating. The following four Specifi c Aims will test theabove hypotheses. (1) Delineate the entry pathways of representative Old and New Worldarenaviruses, using real-time single pseudovirus imaging. (2) Defi ne the role of LBPA in arenavirusfusion and identify the GP lipid-interacting motif. (3) Examine the requirement for GP thiol-disulfi deinterchange in arenavirus fusion. (4) Elucidate a role of GP-mediated virus membranepermeabilization in uncoating. Successful completion of the proposed experiments will provideimportant fundamental insights into the mechanism of arenavirus entry/fusion and identify newtherapeutic targets for intervention.",

    "Abstract": "The recent Ebola epidemic exposed the fragility of Sierra Leoneïs health system and highlighted the inadequate investments to date that are needed to support a well-functioning system capable of responding to a disease outbreak of this magnitude. To improve delivery of quality health services for patients with endemic viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) such as Lassa fever (LF), while strengthening capacity to conduct clinical trials during future epidemic VHF outbreaks such as Ebola, Sierra Leone must grow its pool of qualified health professionals with the methodological skills in implementation science and the conduct of clinical trials. We have just completed a Planning Grant for Emerging Epidemic Virus Research Training for West African Countries with Widespread Transmission of Ebola- Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (D71TW010411), that has allowed us to evaluate existing research capacity of our in-country partner organizations, while refining our strategies for best approaches to address gaps in that capacity. Combining this with our extensive knowledge and history of conducting VHF research in Sierra Leone; as well as nearly two-decades managing institutional research, training, and capacity-building grants; we propose here our comprehensive research training plan in response to PAR-18-840-Global Infectious Disease Research Training. We seek to substantially advance implementation science research capacity at Sierra Leoneïs principal medical school, the University of Sierra Leone (USL), College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences (COMAHS); as well as clinical trial infrastructure at the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) through the proposed Partnership for Research in Emerging Viral Infections-Sierra Leone (PREVSL) [pronounced ?Prev Sil?]. Our Specific Aims are to 1) Enhance research capacity at KGH and COMAHS for the conduct of scientifically valid and ethically acceptable clinical trials, with a focus on Ebola, Lassa, and other VHF; 2) Strengthen and expand the KGH and COMAHS research pool with a focus on Implementation Science research for the clinical management of patients with VHF; and 3) Nurture innovative mentored research by PREVSL trainees/alumni to address the clinical management of VHF. Our comprehensive training program will consist of a combination of (1) long-term Masters training in clinical investigation with a focus on vaccine clinical trial capacity; (2) short- to medium-term clinical trial management training that reinforces south-south collaborations and builds regional networks; (3) short and long-term capacity building in health services implementation science research through in-country short courses and Masters training in Public Health; and (4) sustainable capacity building at KGH and COMAHS for the management and administration of future research grant opportunities.",

    "Abstract": "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) causes a life-threatening tick-borne disease in humans. The disease presents as a severe form of hemorrhagic fever with a case fatality rate of 10?40%. CCHFV outbreaks have spanned a wide geographic area ranging from Western and Central Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Southern Europe. Increasing global temperatures, migratory birds, and the international livestock trade have all potentially contributed toward the spread of Hyalomma ticks?the primary vector for CCHFV. Expanding endemic zones, widespread morbidity and significant mortality make CCHFV an acute threat to public health and thus is listed as a NIAID Category A priority pathogen. The viral genome encodes a glycoprotein precursor that is processed into two structural glycoproteins?Gn and Gc?and two secreted glycoproteins?a mucin-like domain and GP38. Protective antibodies have been isolated that target Gc or GP38, suggesting that these two proteins should be given priority for vaccine development. Here we propose to engineer Gc- and GP38-based immunogens that focus the immune response onto broadly conserved epitopes that are capable of eliciting protective antibody responses. To accomplish our goal, we will structurally characterize CCHFV glycoproteins and their interactions with human-derived antibodies, rationally engineer vaccine antigens based in part on the structural information, and characterize the immune responses elicited by these antigens in animal models. These results will be used to guide further improvements of the immunogens, including display on self-assembling multi-valent nanoparticles, and the most promising candidates will be evaluated in a lethal murine model of CCHFV challenge. Given our expertise, unique reagents, and preliminary data, we are confident that we can deliver a state-of-the-art subunit vaccine candidate with the potential to induce cross-reactive protective antibodies, thereby satisfying an unmet need against this NIAID Category A tick-borne pathogen.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "499362",
    "Abstract": "The Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is transmitted to humans via infected ticks and through animal reservoirs that carry the virus. CCHF is also transmitted to humans through close contact and bodily fluids and has a fatality rate of 10-40%. CCHF is restricted to primarily warmer countries so any vaccine needs to withstand extreme temperatures. The CCHF virus has been found in ticks in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and South Western Europe, the widest geographic region of any tick virus which is a potential threat to human health. With continued global warming, the migration of ticks coupled with large animal transmission, places CCHF on the high priority for vaccine development. With a rapid onset of symptoms which progress from typical viral infections into haemorrhaging from several tracts to uncontrolled bleeding, there is a need for a vaccine that not only prevents CCHF but also treats those with CCHF. pHion Therapeutics have developed a peptide termed RALA that can deliver messenger RNA (mRNA) to antigen producing cells to produce a prophylactic T-Cell memory and a therapeutic CD8+ vaccine response. The vision for this project is to apply pHion's technology to develop a vaccine using RALA to deliver mRNA encoding 3 CCHF antigens that will not only prevent patients contracting CCHF but will also treat those that are infected with CCHF. pHion is the only company that has this RALA peptide which can condense multiple mRNA antigenic sequences into nanoparticles which are lyophilised into a product that is stable for \\>18 months at room temperature. As our mRNA vaccines do not require cold-chain storage, this enables wide-spread distribution. The pre-clinical objectives are designed over 12 months to formulate and assess the CCHF vaccine in challenge models so that the optimal dose and injection regimen is known. This places pHion ready to progress to toxicology, IND filing and into the clinic with the optimal product. There are also manufacturing and scalability advantages of our RALA/mRNA vaccines which include a fully automated cost -effective process that only requires sterile filtration post-production. The development of this platform technology in this project could be the catalyst for a new generation of room-temperature mRNA vaccines. In addition, this investment represents a further validation of pHion's platform technology, further strengthening the UK's position in the vaccine market with potential for global impact.",

    "GrantTitleEng": "Origin of the innate immunity suppression caused by nairovirus' protease activity",
    "GrantAmountConverted": "79208",
    "Abstract": "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a ssRNA (-) nairovirus that produces fever, prostration, and severe hemorrhages in humans. Fatality rates associated with CCHFV range from 5- 80% based on phylogenetic variation of the virus, transmission route, and different treatment facilities. Originally identified in Russia and the Congo, CCHFV has rapidly spread across large sections of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Recently, CCHFV has illustrated its continued ability to spread into previously naive regions. At the same time, U.S. citizen traffic has increased substantially to the regions endemic with CCHFV, specifically South-Central Asia. As a result, there is a substantial risk for transmission of CCHFV and/or its tick vector to the United States. Intriguingly, CCHFV is not the only nairovirus that threatens the public. Nairobi Sheep Disease virus (NSDV) as well as nairoviruses Issyk-kul, Dugbe and Erve can cause human disease of varying severity and economic distress. There is no vaccine or prophylactic currently available for treatment of CCHF or any other nairovirus related disease. Reports have identified a viral homologue of the ovarian tumor protease (vOTU) located within the nairovirus genome. Recently, vOTUs? ability to reverse post-translational modification by proteins ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like interferon-simulated gene 15 (ISG15) on a narrow subset of host pathways has been illustrated to be critical to pathogenesis. Also, vOTUs from CCHFV and other nairoviruses have been found to be sensitive to species-species variations in ISG15 and their specificity includes at least the species that disease is most prominently identified. This proposal will determine the identity of specific host proteins within those pathways targeted by vOTUs. This will enable therapeutic approaches that protect, or elevate, specific host inhibitory factors for these viruses. The proposal will also seek to evaluate the correlation between the in vitro activity/substrate species-specificity of these nairovirus vOTUs and overall virulence and zoonotic range of the nairoviruses in question. Additionally, the efficacy of using CCHFV vaccine candidates with altered CCHF vOTU functions will be assessed. Together, the resulting information will provide critical insight into the role of vOTUs play in pathogenesis and host restriction as well as advance the development of prophylactics targeting vOTUs.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "829151",
    "Abstract": "Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne disease with high mortality rates in humans and high outbreak potential. Found in 30 countries across Europe, Asia, and Africa,ÿCCHFÿhas an extremely widespread and growing range. Its causative agent,ÿCCHFÿvirus (CCHFV), is listed among the urgently concerning pathogens prioritized in the WHO R&D Blueprint. With at least seven regional clades,ÿCCHFV detection by gold standard qPCR- based methods has been encumbered by significant strain-associated genetic variability. Existing tests forÿCCHFV are often limited to regional use, presenting a barrier to standardization and quality assurance. The WHO has called for the development of universalÿCCHFV diagnostics as a global priority. Aldatu Biosciences has pioneered the use of PANDAA technology, which enables probe-based qPCR for target detection in highly variable genomic regions by simultaneously adapting and amplifying diverse templates. PANDAA uniquely mitigates the presence of target- proximal polymorphisms to allow otherwise divergent templates to be detected with consensus fluorescent probes with similar sensitivities. As such, PANDAA-enabled qPCR is an ideal solution for universal detection of pathogens with significant strain, lineage, and/or sub-type sequence diversity. Aldatu Biosciences is uniquely positioned to deliver a rapid pan-lineage qPCR-basedÿCCHFV diagnostic. PANDAA has been successfully applied to subtype- independent detection of more than fifteen drug resistance mutation (DRM) targets in HIV. Recently, we completed development of the first pan-lineage assay for Lassa fever virus (LASV), another WHO priority pathogen with high outbreak potential. We propose to leverage the unique capabilities of PANDAA to develop a rapid, sensitive molecular diagnostic assay forÿCCHFV detection, and the first with pan-lineage coverage, through the following specific aims: (1) development of a pan-lineage PANDAA-CCHFV assay, leveraging proven techniques and proprietary PANDAA reagent design; (2) analytical validation of the PANDAA-CCHFV assay, including confirmation of clade inclusivity and high specificity; (3) thermostabilization of the PANDAA-CCHFV assay, in order to meet the requirements of diagnostics targeted to LMICs; (4) clinical validation of the lyophilized PANDAA-CCHFV assay, using clinical samples representing a broad variety of circulating clades and geographies; and (5) multi-site evaluation of the PANDAA qDxÿCCHFV test kit at reference labs at CDC- and WHO-affiliated partner institutions. As the first pan- lineage assay, PANDAA-CCHFV will provide a rapid, standardized testing option for all regions within the broad range ofÿCCHFV. This novel, pan-lineage detection assay could ultimately be deployed in any endemic region on pre-existing qPCR equipment in central labs, and/or integrated into a closed, point-of-care system with sample processing to radically improve theÿCCHFV diagnostic workflow.",

    "Abstract": "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a ssRNA (-) nairovirus that produces fever, prostration, and severe hemorrhages in humans. Fatality rates associated with CCHFV range from 5- 80% based on phylogenetic variation of the virus, transmission route, and different treatment facilities. Originally identified in Russia and the Congo, CCHFV has rapidly spread across large sections of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Recently, CCHFV has illustrated its continued ability to spread into previously naive regions. At the same time, U.S. citizen traffic has increased substantially to the regions endemic with CCHFV, specifically South-Central Asia. As a result, there is a substantial risk for transmission of CCHFV and/or its tick vector to the United States. Intriguingly, CCHFV is not the only nairovirus that threatens the public. Nairobi Sheep Disease virus (NSDV) as well as nairoviruses Issyk-kul, Dugbe and Erve can cause human disease of varying severity and economic distress. There is no vaccine or prophylactic currently available for treatment of CCHF or any other nairovirus related disease. Reports have identified a viral homologue of the ovarian tumor protease (vOTU) located within the nairovirus genome. Recently, vOTUs? ability to reverse post-translational modification by proteins ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like interferon-simulated gene 15 (ISG15) on a narrow subset of host pathways has been illustrated to be critical to pathogenesis. Also, vOTUs from CCHFV and other nairoviruses have been found to be sensitive to species-species variations in ISG15 and their specificity includes at least the species that disease is most prominently identified. This proposal will determine the identity of specific host proteins within those pathways targeted by vOTUs. This will enable therapeutic approaches that protect, or elevate, specific host inhibitory factors for these viruses. The proposal will also seek to evaluate the correlation between the in vitro activity/substrate species-specificity of these nairovirus vOTUs and overall virulence and zoonotic range of the nairoviruses in question. Additionally, the efficacy of using CCHFV vaccine candidates with altered CCHF vOTU functions will be assessed. Together, the resulting information will provide critical insight into the role of vOTUs play in pathogenesis and host restriction as well as advance the development of prophylactics targeting vOTUs.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "377408",
    "Abstract": "Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever virus (CCHFv) is the most widespread tick-borne viral disease affecting people. It is endemic in \\>30 countries, almost all of which are LMICs in Africa, the Balkans, Middle East and Central Asia with an estimated 3 billion people at risk. The expanding geographic range of the tick along with trade in infected but asymptomatic livestock is fuelling the spread of CCHFv. Virus outbreaks occur in agricultural areas in workers with close contact with animals, spreading to family members and health workers. Thus CCHFv affects regions and countries least able to deal with CCHFv or afford vaccine development. There is no vaccine, nor effective treatment; early intensive care, rehydration and supportive drug therapy are the main care pathways. There are 10-15,000 cases annually; 1 in 8 develop severe disease with mortality rates between 10 and 40% (WHO). Survivors typically experience long term debilitating symptoms that have additional socio-economic impacts. Our project aims to develop a safe, affordable and effective vaccine for CCHFv using our platform technologies for producing high quality proteins, including viral glycoproteins, in insect cells. This project will build on the results and achievements of our current UK Vaccine Network project and ensure we are well prepared and ready to move to Phase I/II Clinical Trials in future. In this 1 year project, we will finalise the adjuvant to be used with the vaccine, which ensures a good immune response and protection. The aim is to achieve protection after an initial and one booster dose. Current tests of vaccine performance depend on the use of an animal model in high containment facilities to assess protection from the virus. We will develop an alternative approach that is animal-free and utilizes a cell culture-based method performed in lower containment laboratories. This will enable effective but more affordable assessment of vaccine efficacy/immune response in future Clinical Phases of vaccine development. We will also optimize stability of the vaccine, which currently can be preserved for 1 month in a refrigerator. Based on work with a prototype COVID-19 vaccine produced in the same system we think this can be improved to 3 to 6 months. This will reduce the burden of cold chain supply in LMICs. Finally, we will create a regulatory package and develop a detailed plan to undertake Phase I/Phase II Trials to allow future Clinical work packages to start as soon as funding is available.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "612728",
    "Abstract": "The threat posed by tick-borne diseases (TBD) in temperate regions such as the UK is growing rapidly. Human exposure is often linked to woodlands that support high densities of tick vectors and key wildlife hosts of these pathogens, and are intensively used by people. Climate change and government policies to increase woodland connectivity and improve human recreational access are highly likely to increase risks of TBD in the UK. To mitigate this threat we need to better understand effects of landscape structure on the movement and habitat use of those wildlife species which are key hosts for ticks and zoonotic pathogens. We also need to understand how humans use landscapes, where they are most at risk of exposure to tick bites and whether exposure could be prevented by habitat and host management. Given recent shifts across Europe in the distributions of TBD and tick populations, it is also critical to understand how longer term climate and land use changes may affect the introduction, establishment and spread of TBDs.\n\nBringing together researchers from ecology, epidemiology, public health, and social science, TICKSOLVE aims to address these gaps. We will provide evidence for optimal greening and woodland restoration policies that will maximise benefits to biodiversity and human wellbeing while minimising human risks from current and future tick-borne diseases by:\n1. Bringing together key national and regional level actors in health, land and biodiversity policy that interact with landscapes and TBD systems, to frame key risk scenarios and feasible environmental interventions for TBDs.\n2. Better understanding how landscape structure shapes wildlife host distribution, habitat selection and movements and consequently impacts on ticks and TBD risk combining ecological surveys, pathogen genetics and computer modelling\n3. Mapping how people use woodland landscapes and how this interacts with risk of encountering infected ticks to identify high risk areas for human exposure\n4. Modelling how potential environmental barriers and interventions could reduce human exposure, integrating this knowledge of ecological interactions across the landscapes\n5. Predicting how changes in woodland area and climate and patterns of bird migration may change TBD risks in the future\n6. Co-developing interventions to minimise current and future TBD risks with stakeholders and policymakers that are locally appropriate.The research will focus on three emerging pathogens that pose a risk to the UK. Firstly Lyme disease (LD) which is currently present in the UK and can cause long-term debilitation. Reported cases of LD have increased 10-fold since 2000, probably linked to an expanding distribution of its main tick vector, Ixodes ricinus. Secondly, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) which has been recently detected in ticks in the UK with evidence of suspected human cases in 2019. TBE uses the same tick vector and can cause severe neurological damage and death with some 5,000 to 12,000 reported cases each year in mainland Europe. Thirdly, Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), caused by a WHO priority pathogen CCHF virus, with epidemic potential, is expanding north-westward in Europe. It's tick vector, Hyalomma spp., was found recently on migratory birds arriving in the UK. The TICKSOLVE project platform and approach of co-developing research, models and risk communication materials with stakeholders, accounting for diverse land management priorities, will enable formulation of future-proofed woodland and greening policies that minimise risks of these diverse TBDs. Furthermore, engagement with key global partners and networks through webinars and meetings will facilitate transfer of TICKSOLVE inter-disciplinary approaches to other rapidly changing tick-borne disease systems worldwide.",

    "Abstract": "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne emerging pathogen that causes severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans across a broad geographic range that includes more than 30 countries. The NIAID lists CCHFV as a Category A priority pathogen, a biological agent that poses the highest risk to national security and public health. CCHF is of particular importance to public health as there are no licensed vaccines or treatments available for use in humans, and because of the concern that the virus could be used as an agent of biological terrorism. The goal of this project is to advance the development of a recombinant vaccine based on next generation vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vectors expressing the CCHFV glycoprotein as a potential medical countermeasure that can provide protection across all six genetically distinct clades of CCHFV. This application proposes to develop and pre-clinically validate a rVSV vectored CCHF vaccine. Next generation Vesiculovax? CCHF vaccines will be compared head-to-head with a prototype rVSV vaccine that has been shown to completely protect animals against lethal CCHFV infection. Vaccines will be compared for immunogenicity, lack of neurovirulence, and the ability to protect STAT-1 knockout mice against all six M segment clades of CCHFV. A lead candidate vaccine will then be down selected. Supporting studies using a newly developed lethal nonhuman primate model of CCHFV will be employed to confirm protective efficacy of the lead vaccine candidate, assess the ability to the vaccine to provide rapid protection, and finally to begin to determine correlates of protection. This proposal will draw together expertise in vaccine development, CCHFV biology, and animal modeling needed to develop a vaccine that meets both the outbreak and bioweapon scenarios that require rapid protection against all CCHFV clades with a single administration.\n",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "819319",
    "Abstract": "The 2013?2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) disease epidemic was orders of magnitude larger than any previous EBOV outbreak. Preliminary data indicate that GP-A82V, an EBOV glycoprotein mutant that came to dominate the outbreak, increases infectivity in human cells. To elucidate the mechanism by which GP-A82V increases infectivity, and to clarify its significance for Ebola virus replication and transmission, we have assembled a team that leverages NIAID resources at the IRF-Fort Detrick and the Genomic Center for Infectious Diseases at The Broad Institute. Aim 1 will be to investigate the mechanism by which GP-A82V increases virion fusogenicity. Computer modeling suggests that GP-A82V destabilizes glycoprotein conformation. Mutations engineered based on the models will be tested for effects on infectivity, the reorganization of critical interactions as determined by molecular dynamics simulations, conformational equilibrium as determined by smFRET, novel assays for GP fusion, Cryo-EM of GP trimers, and crystal complexes with the NPC1 C-loop. Aim 2 will be to assess the effect of GP-A82V in the context of the EBOV Makona variant on infectivity in human cells in vitro and in humanized mice. We will generate a reverse genetic system for the ancestral EBOV Makona lineage and test the effect of GP-A82V on this background. Replication of WT and GP-A82V will be compared in U20S cells, in human dendritic cells, and in a novel humanized mouse model where the effect of GP-A82V on virus sequence adaptation to specific tissue compartments will be assessed. From these experiments we expect to clarify the significance of GP-A82V for viral replication and transmission, taking into account the genetic background of the EBOV and the species-specific effects of GP-A82V. Aim 3 will be to examine the effect of GP-A82V on neutralizing antibodies. Preliminary data indicate that GP-A82V is relatively resistant to neutralization by particular antibodies. Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies targeting different parts of GP, we will determine whether neutralization resistance is a general property of GP-A82V, or if this trait is specific to antibodies targeting particular regions of GP. If differential neutralization is observed with particular antibodies, the effect of these on viral titer will be tested in the humanized mouse model. We will also determine whether GP-A82V alters neutralization sensitivity to convalescent sera from Guineans infected early or later in the outbreak, and from individuals treated at Emory University. From these studies we hope to determine whether the antibody response to EBOV was different depending on whether a person was infected with virus bearing GP-A82 or GP-A82V. If differences in neutralization titer correlate with virus genotype it would contribute to understanding the factors that determine survival in an infected individual or the efficiency of transmission to people who come into contact with infected body fluids. Finally, these studies will provide valuable experimental tools that will inform our studies on GP structure and function.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "645377",
    "Abstract": "Human mobility underlies infectious disease transmission and determines the spatial-temporal dynamics of outbreaks and endemic disease dynamics. Yet, we do not understand how best to incorporate individual or population mobility patterns into models of infectious diseases. Human travel has been successfully incorporated into models used for planning, surveillance, and reactive responses to influenza pandemics, the COVID-19 pandemic, malaria, and others. However, little validation or comparison of approaches used in these models has been performed. Further, there has been no systematic investigation of the extent to which the many different existing sources of human travel data quantify travel patterns, or which descriptions of human mobility are most relevant to disease processes. The small amount of human mobility data available globally requires generalization or extrapolation of features of one dataset to another setting, time or circumstance. This generalization may work for some features of pathogens for a subset of pathogens or transmission routes but may fail miserably in others. It is unlikely that all travel patterns are relevant for all types of diseases. The life history of each pathogen, transmission routes, age structure of incidence and outbreak context will all dictate the importance of specific types of movement. For mobility data to be useful in planning for outbreaks and monitoring interventions, transmission models utilizing mobility data and models must be confronted with epidemiological data (including contact tracing, traditional surveillance, and genetic data) from a variety of sources. Here, we propose to perform the first systematic analysis of existing mobility data and models to identify which models perform best under multiple assumptions using a range of simulations and data from historic outbreaks. We will also identify circumstances when generalized models or non-local data are misleading. To do this, we will collate and standardize a large number of mobility datasets collected by various methods. We will statistically characterize these datasets to identify sources of variation in human mobility at individual, household, community, and larger scales. We will develop multiple candidate models describing mobility and incorporate these candidate models into a range of commonly used models of infectious disease transmission. Proceeding with the principle that human mobility is only useful to models of infectious diseases if it improves our ability to recapitulate the dynamics of observed outbreaks, we will test the ability of each of these candidate mobility models to explain observed patterns of contacts and sequenced pathogens observed in outbreaks of dengue, Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19. In doing this, we will identify conditions under which human mobility can improve our understanding of the transmission and pathogens, inform response strategies and create a resource that can inform responses to multiple current and future outbreaks.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "1285221",
    "Abstract": "On 20th September 2022, the Ministry of Health of Uganda confirmed the first case of the Sudan Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) at Mubende Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) through testing done at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI). As of 15/11/2022, the epidemic has spread to 9 districts in Uganda with 141 confirmed cases, 55 confirmed deaths, including 19 health workers (7 of whom have died) [1]. Mubende district (population 720,000) has been the epi-centre of this epidemic contributing 58/141 (41%) of the confirmed cases and 2,173 contacts and since the 15/10/2022 been under lockdown. The population in the district of Mubende is under intense psychological distress arising both from the direct effects of the Ebola epidemic on individuals and families and indirectly from the negative effects of the Ebola containment measures on livelihoods and on the economy of the district [1]. This project aims to support mental health services in Mubende district (population 720,000) to cope with the negative mental health and psychosocial consequences of the EVD outbreak. This project will employ a health systems strengthening approach to enhance the still fragile mental health services in the district and at the same time to ensure sustainability. The Mental Health Section of the MRC/UVRI & LSHTM Uganda Research Unit will work with the Mental Health and Control of Substance Use, Division of the Ministry of Health and Mubende District Medical Services to implement this project.",

One area that has yet to be fully explored is the ability of the gut microbiome to influence the efficacy of T cell vaccines through direct, or indirect influences on CD8+ T cell responsiveness. This studentship will seek to understand and exploit the ability of commensal gut microbes to influence the human immune response to T cell vaccination. This is an interdisciplinary project that will begin by combining trials of viral vaccines (e.g. HIV and Ebola vaccines) with in-depth multi-omic analysis to identify functional variation in the gut microbiome associated with immunological markers of vaccine success. It will progress to using in vivo models to study the potential of specific microbes (or microbial products) as adjuvants to improve T cell vaccine response. The studentship will develop interdisciplinary skills in immunology, computational biology, and use of in vivo models as a basis for studying immune-gut microbiome interaction.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "901602",
    "Abstract": "Outbreaks of Ebola have gripped the world's attention in recent years, from the Western Africa Ebola epidemic of 2013-2016 to the ongoing outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The first outbreak of the Ebola virus was recorded in 1976 in what was then called Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo); 318 cases were identified, of which 280 people died. Since that time, changes to infrastructure, travel patterns, population density, and climate have led to larger and more frequent epidemic outbreaks of the disease. The Western Africa Ebola epidemic saw cases spread as far as Italy, Spain, and the United States. The outbreak in DRC is now in its 11th month with no signs of abating and extensive disruptions and cost for local people. Humanitarian groups including M‚decins Sans FrontiŠres (MSF) and the British Red Cross (BRC) are organising local responses to the crisis, but the magnitude of the problem is so great that there are no established techniques for resolving it. Humanitarians are in urgent need of operational intelligence in order to fight increasingly large epidemics. To that end, this fellowship aims to develop a simulation of the spread of Ebola through a region as a function of human behaviour and movement. I will undertake this work in conjunction with partners from MSF's Manson Unit for Innovation and BRC's GIS team. The project will create and make use of an agent based model (ABM) to simulate the interactions and choices of individual people living, working, and moving within Ebola-effected areas. By capturing the ways in which Ebola is transmitted between people through funerary practices, caring relationships, and the seeking of medical care, the simulation will help the project's humanitarian partners understand how different interventions may influence the spread of disease in these social contexts. The research will particularly focus on analysing and visualising the results in ways that are accessible to the humanitarian project partners. The work will make use of open source data to estimate populations and recreate transportation networks. These synthetically generated datasets will be fed into the ABM, giving more insight into where outbreaks may flare up and where they may travel next based on appropriate local behaviours and choices. In turn, the software developed as part of the project will be made open source. By making the simulation software freely available, the research will be accessible to the humanitarian partners, but also government organisations and other researchers. The toolkits will be developed with the needs of non-specialists in mind, so that they are suitable for users with potentially sensitive datasets and without high-powered machines or constant access to the internet. The project aims to strengthen the ties between academics and humanitarians, and to make cutting edge methodologies available to non-specialists. The fellowship will provide resources to help humanitarians and government to understand their options in the fight against Ebola. It will also make these new tools available to other researchers, propagating outward and facilitating new work. Finally, it will allow me to establish myself as an internationally recognised leader in the field of ABM for humanitarian modelling, allowing me to push this line of research forward in the future.\n",

    "Abstract": "The recent epidemics of Ebola in West Africa and the current COVID-19 pandemic highlight the need for a critical mass of well-trained scientists and public health research professionals capable of studying and responding appropriately, and a in timely manner, to emerging infectious diseases (EID) threats. This competitive new application supports a new training program on EIDs in Mali and Guinea. This will build upon and expand the scope of the existing FIC/NIH D43 training program based in the Department of Public Health at the University of Sciences, Techniques and Technologies of Bamako (USTTB) and leverage on existing NIAID collaborative research programs in the two countries. The existing D43 training program has a focus on malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), but does not include training and other capacity-building in surveillance, laboratory diagnosis, and control of viral pathogens such as Ebola Virus Disease, COVID-19 and Lassa Fever. With maturation of our training and research on malaria and NTDs, and an increased supply of highly qualified mentors and trainees in Mali, we propose an increased emphasis on training on EIDs in Mali and Guinea and mentoring by Malian, Guinean and US researchers. This training program will provide a curriculum for training doctoral and master?s students in advanced field epidemiology and laboratory practices, as well as non-degree certifications (professional skill enhancement) in translational clinical research, public health emergency management and genomic surveillance of emerging infectious pathogens, preparing Guinea and Mali to better handle potential future epidemics. This program is a south-south collaboration effort between Guinea and Mali, supported by Johns Hopkins School of Public Health (JHSPH), to have researchers from both sides collaborate more closely on these cross-border diseases for more coordinated and efficient public health responses. The training program will support six doctoral students and 15 master?s students. Dissertation of Doctoral and Master thesis research will include research questions related or applicable to Ebola and other EIDs. Supported students will take courses from, and be mentored by, faculty from the University of Conakry, USTTB, and JHSPH. Selected students will have the opportunity to take online courses at JHSPH that are not offered at the University of Conakry or USTTB. The program will also provide faculty enrichment through training and coursework for eight faculty members, which may include trainings or online coursework at JHSPH and will provide laboratory training for five research scientists (students or faculty). Short courses will also be offered twice per year, training 120 public health professionals and young scientists in topics related to the control of EIDs. This support will greatly enhance capacity in Guinea and Mali to respond to and control impending outbreaks of EIDs in their own countries, and in the West African region.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "248625",
    "Abstract": "Historically, approximately 70% of people in Africa infected with Ebola virus have died. Most commonly, people develop vomiting and diarrhea, become severely dehydrated, their blood pressure falls, and their vital organs fail. If we can support patients until they receive specific treatments and produce antibodies to clear the virus from their system, mortality in Africa falls to about 40%. Governments and humanitarian organizations did not believe it was possible to deliver such care in the West African outbreak; however, one Ebola treatment center in West Africa demonstrated it was possible to provide critical care, including life-sustaining support for the heart, lungs and kidneys. Among patients evacuated to European and US hospitals with advanced critical care, just 20% of patients die. We have built a simulated treatment centre in Canada to \"practice\" the provision of advanced care to patients, demonstrating to others that we can deliver excellent care to help patients survive. Our Canadian treatment unit is a collaboration with the Canadian Forces, humanitarian aid organizations, African colleagues and the WHO. It simulates the temperature & humidity of West Africa, and with medical mannequins, we are testing the feasibility and safety for health workers in wearing protective medical equipment while providing resuscitation, mechanical ventilation and dialysis. This treatment unit and procedures will serve as an example to health teams - humanitarian organizations, African and Canadian - about what is possible. Our team has experience treating Ebola patients, building treatment centers in Africa, training health workers, and with support from CIHR have completed preparatory testing. We are ready to begin the next phase of this research. By involving trainees and engaging partners from Africa and Canada throughout the process, we are poised to influence Ebola care around the world.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "406504",
    "Abstract": "Viral host shutoff proteins selectively hijack cellular machinery to aid viral propagation. In SARS coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2), nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) serves as the host shutoff factor by dampening host gene expression through ribosomal stalling on host mRNAs followed by their cleavage and decay. However, how nsp1 selectively targets host mRNAs over the viral RNA remains an unsolved puzzle. The long-term goal of this research is to study the steps of nsp1-mediated host shutoff to clearly understand how it specifically selects host mRNAs but not capped and polyadenylated viral RNA that resembles host mRNAs. The rationale for this project is based on the observation that the deletion of stem-loop 1 (SL1) from the viral RNA leader sequence eliminates its ability to escape host shutoff. A critical factor in differentiating viral RNA from host mRNA lies in the interaction between nsp1 and SL1. Based on our previously published results that nsp1 associates with stress granule proteins and disengages G3BP1 protein from the stress granule, we propose to examine the protein and RNA composition of stress granules to determine if viral RNA is protected from decay because of its specific localization connected to the interaction between nsp1 and viral RNA. In Aim 1, we propose to conduct an in-depth study of the interaction between nsp1 and SL1 that will map the sequence responsible for binding, characterize the proteomic profile of the host proteins bound to SL1, and analyze the effect of nsp1 on host mRNA translation and stability. In Aim 2, we propose to examine the disassembly of stress granules in the presence of nsp1 and study its effect on selective cleavage and decay of host mRNA. This multidisciplinary collaborative research will engage undergraduate students to be trained in a highly transformative experience with a team of biochemists, computer scientists, and immunologists to explore a current and relevant topic in biomedical sciences. Overall, our research will connect nsp1?s ability to bind viral RNA sequence to RNA stability and localization and will allow us to examine the mechanism that leads to host mRNA cleavage and decay. Finally, this project will identify interactors of nsp1 and pave the way for designing anti-viral therapeutics.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "805612",
    "Abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus identified at the end of 2019, has led to the current global pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 virus belongs to the subgenus sarbecovirus of the genus betacoronavirus, the genus from which two SARS-CoV-2 closely related viruses (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV) have crossed the species barrier to humans in the past 17 years. These coronaviruses have crossed into humans through zoonotic transmissions from animal reservoirs highlighting a potential threat for future spillovers. Therefore, development of intervention strategies that can mitigate outbreaks of future coronaviruses is critical. To prepare for future coronavirus (CoV) pandemics, it is desirable to generate vaccines capable of eliciting neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses against diverse CoVs. Currently there are two major challenges to develop prophylactic vaccine-based strategies against coronaviruses; 1) identification of CoV spike broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) sites for vaccine targeting; and 2) the development of vaccine strategies that can reproducibly induce durable and protective bnAb responses against a broad range of coronaviruses. In this R01 grant application, we will squarely address these knowledge gaps by employing a bnAb epitope based rational vaccine design approach to develop immunogens and immunization strategies that can induce coronavirus protective bnAb responses by vaccination. The project consists of 3 aims: Aim #1 will design novel spike S2 stem bnAb site targeting vaccine immunogens using a rational reverse vaccine engineering approach. Using CoV spike S2 stem helix bnAbs and their UCAs we will design, CoV S2 stem peptide-based nanoparticles, rationally engineered S2 bnAb germline-targeting S-protein trimer immunogens and their multimerized nanoparticle versions that can efficiently in vivo activate B cell precursors targeting the S2 stem region conserved across ?-CoV spikes. Aim #2 will iteratively evaluate and optimize prime boost immunization strategies in appropriate pre-clinical animal models to develop vaccine protocols that can reproducibly induce durable and protective bnAb responses against diverse ?-CoVs. We will assess the in vivo protective efficacy of the vaccine- induced bnAb responses in appropriate virus challenge models. Aim #3 will generate spike S2 stem helix bnAb based ?super antibodies? against ?-coronaviruses by utilizing rational antibody engineering approaches. The overall goal of this R01 grant proposal is to rationally design novel vaccine immunogen candidates, develop robust vaccination strategies that can induce durable protective bnAb responses against a broad range of ?- coronaviruses and develop ?super antibody? molecules promising for broad coronaviruses intervention strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and emerging coronaviruses as part of pandemic preparedness.",

    "GrantTitleEng": "Human coronavirus infection of the nasal epithelium",
    "GrantAmountConverted": "743489",
    "Abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 emerged in China in late 2019, resulting in the COVID-19 pandemic. Like SARS-CoV (2002) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV (2012), SARS-CoV-2 can progress to cause lethal pneumonia. In contrast, infections with ?common? respiratory CoVs (NL63, 229E, OC43) are largely limited to the upper respiratory tract. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 and in particular the omicron variant, can sometimes cause primarily upper respiratory infections. Thus, despite their highly conserved genome structure and shared replication schemes, human CoVs induce varying degrees of disease. Respiratory CoVs initiate infection through the nose, though few studies have addressed CoV infection of the nasal epithelium. We have an established cryobank of nasal epithelial cells from over 1000 genetically characterized individuals capable of being expanded and grown as air liquid interface (ALI) cultures, recapitulating the nasal respiratory epithelium. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that SARS-2 (and its emerging variants), MERS and NL63 all productively infect these cultures. However, NL63 only replicates at a lower temperature (33C), infects single cells rather than clusters (evinced by SARS-2/MERS) and causes a more cytopathic effect than SARS-2 or MERS, suggesting it may induce a robust local immune response thereby limiting its replication to the upper respiratory tract or stimulating an adaptive immune response prior to infecting the lower airway. One COVID-19 risk locus includes the leucine zipper transcription factor-like 1 gene (LZTFL1), which we show is highly expressed in ciliated nasal cells, with ubiquitous expression throughout the cytoplasm. Our preliminary data of SARS-CoV-2 infected cultures genotyped for the high vs low-risk LZTFL1 polymorphisms demonstrate that LZTFL1 could play a role in variability of SARS-CoV-2 spread. In addition, polymorphisms in OAS1, a sensor of double-stranded viral RNA that initiates the antiviral RNase L pathway, have been linked to COVID-19 resistance. We have extensive experience in this pathway and recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 activates RNase L while MERS-CoV shuts it down. Based on these and other data, we hypothesize that pathogenic outcomes of CoV infections are reflected in viral biology in the nasal epithelium. Thus, using a battery of diverse CoVs we will assess differences in cell entry and spread, optimal temperature for viral replication and shedding as well as host nasal cell responses to each CoV. We propose to use our biobank to identify host and viral factors affecting the establishment of infection, host cytokine and nasal antiviral responses and the contribution of polymorphisms in LZTFL1 and OAS1 genes in the outcome of infection. Our complementary expertise in coronavirus biology (Weiss) and nasal pathophysiology (Cohen) uniquely positions us to address these Aims. This work will contribute to understanding nasal CoV infection, the divergence of lethal and common CoVs as well as variation in clinical course among SARS-CoV-2 infections, and may lead to novel targeted prophylaxis or therapeutic strategies targeting the nose, the site of initial contact.\nPublic Health Relevance Statement\nNarrative Infection of primary nasal epithelial cultures with human respiratory coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 (and its variants) and MERS-CoV and the common coronaviruses HCoV-NL63, -229E and -OC43 will be used to model the earliest site of infection and identify similarities and difference in replication, cytopathic effects and host response to these viruses that progress to different clinical severities. Cultures derived from individuals with risk polymorphisms in genes associated with COVID-19 will identify mechanisms underlying risk for disease. These studies will contribute to designing strategies to prevent or counteract infection with current coronaviruses and those that are likely to emerge in the future.",

    "GrantAmountConverted": "967225",
    "Abstract": "Targeted therapeutic agents range in size from very small organic molecules (100?s of Da) to protein-based molecules like monoclonal antibodies (~150,000 Da). Small disulfide bonded peptides have evolved in many species, including plants and animals, to have ideal pharmacological properties including high affinity target binding, stability to proteases, heat and other stresses. Such peptides include ?cyclotides? or ?knottins? which can inhibit enzymes, ion channels, and GPCRs with high potency and are often the major active component of venoms of many predator organisms. We have uncovered convergent evolution between ultralong third complementary determining regions (CDR H3s) in the heavy chain of an unusual class of cow antibodies and cyclotide/knottin peptides. We can produce these ?knob? peptides in microbial systems and they retain the binding and potency properties of the parent antibody. These tiny peptide-based molecules are small (~4-6 kDa), highly stable, and can bind targets at subnanomolar KD. We have already developed a panel of virus neutralizing knob peptides against SARS-CoV-2 which bind unique epitopes, and some of which maintain high affinity binding to various SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the recent ?delta? and ?omicron? strains. The high stability, potency, and straightforward manufacturing path enables multiple routes of administration, potentially including inhaled or intranasal delivery, which could be very important prophylactic or treatment in the current or future coronavirus pandemic. Our goals in this project are to further develop the technology to identify peptidic knob domains, expand our panel of knobs against SARS-CoV-2 variants and other coronaviruses like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV- 1, understand the structural basis of their binding, and validate their activity in vitro and in vivo. The knobs identified here can potentially be used as monotherapy or combination therapy in the current or a new coronavirus pandemic, and will be a valuable new therapeutic class to add to the arsenal against coronavirus disease.",

    "Abstract": "Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoV) are responsible for three major epidemics/pandemics in the 21st century, including Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and Middle East Respiratory coronavirus (MERS- CoV) in 2012. In Dec 2019, a third novel coronavirus (CoV) designated SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan China and in the space of 11 months, has caused over 85 million cases, >1.8 million deaths in >217 countries. Over 1/5 of these total cases have been reported in the US, resulting in over 350,000 deaths. In humans, virus infection results in COVID-19 disease, characterized by pneumonia and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), an often-fatal end-stage lung disease. In addition to SARS-CoV2, multiple other SARS-like and MERS-like CoV strains reside in bats and other species and are poised to emerge at some point in the future. The threat posed by these viruses creates a need for the development of broadly efficacious antivirals and vaccines that will protect against this heterogeneous family of highly pathogenic emerging viruses. In response, our assembled team in this P01 of leading virologists with complementary expertise in viral immunity, CoV pathogenesis, antibody repertoire mapping, vaccinology and structure-based vaccine design have developed an integrated program designed to develop panbetaCoV vaccines that protect against the Merbecoviruses (MERS-like group 2c) and Sarbecoviruses (SARS-like group 2b CoV). Project 1, led by the Baric and Heise laboratories at UNC, will develop and test panels of wildtype and chimeric vaccines developed in the context of a well-established alphavirus replicon particle (VRP) vaccine platform. They will interface with other projects and cores to map the location of broadly neutralizing antibody epitopes that will inform panCoV vaccine design. They will also produce killed and live attenuated viruses as vaccine gold standards and models for vaccine induced immune pathology phenotypes (VARED). Project 1 also provides mouse models of human disease, including the first lethal mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA10 variant that replicates efficiently and produces ARDS like disease phenotypes in standard laboratory mice. They also provide novel mouse models of human disease for other SARS-like and MERS-like CoV. Project 1 also provides reporter viruses expressing nLUC, that span the group 2 and group 1 CoV that provide precise measures of neutralizing antibody titer, breadth and magnitude following natural infection and vaccination. Finally, they provide robust heterologous challenge models for evaluating the breadth and performance of emerging coronavirus vaccines. The overall goal is to develop a panCoV vaccine that will universally protect against group 2b and 2c CoV. Aim 1 deciphers the antigenic structure of the BetaCoV. Aim 2 measures group 2b and 2c vaccine performance after virus challenge. Aim 3 develops and tests panbetaCoV vaccine candidates.",

    "Abstract": "Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are pandemic threats. MERS-CoV continues to cause new zoonotic and human transmission and illness with ~35% mortality. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapies to treat any CoV. New zoonotic CoVs likely will emerge from heterogeneous virus pools in animal reservoirs, thus requiring antiviral strategies aimed at completely conserved and vulnerable targets. CoVs rapidly select for resistance to multiple classes of inhibitors, demonstrating the need for approaches to prevent resistance emergence. Both SARS and MERS infections manifest as severe immunopathologic damage, potentially limiting the therapeutic window for direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Immunomodulation in the absence of antivirals has been shown to not be beneficial and to even exacerbate SARS and MERS disease. Thus, combinations of DAAs and targeted immunomodulators may be necessary for effective treatment of established infection. The overall goal of our program is to develop CoV antiviral strategies that broadly inhibit known and future potential pandemic zoonotic CoVs, prevent emergence of resistance, and extend the therapeutic window by targeting host immunopathologic responses. The proposed research will advance preclinical development of the CoV-inhibitory nucleoside analogue EIDD- 1931/2801 and other nucleoside analogues in the pipeline and test two small-molecule hits identified as highly active against SARS-CoV for treatment and prevention of epidemic and pre-emergent CoVs. In Specific Aim 1, the spectrum of antiviral activity and therapeutic efficacy of compounds will be defined. The antiviral efficacy, metabolism, and cytotoxicity of each compound will be determined in cultures of primary human lung cells targeted by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of lead compounds will be evaluated in young, aged, and immunosuppressed murine models of SARS and MERS pathogenesis. In Specific Aim 2, the mechanism of action of lead compounds and kinetics of drug resistance will be determined. The antiviral effect of compounds on virus replication, fidelity, and induction of innate immunity will be assessed. Resistance mutations in genomes of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV passaged in the presence of increasing concentrations of drug will be determined by deep sequencing. The impact of resistance on SARS-CoV and MERS- CoV virulence, sensitivity to other drugs, and therapeutic efficacy of lead compounds will be determined. Specific Aim 3 will focus on the development of combination regimens for the treatment of emerging CoVs. The combined therapeutic efficacy of DAAs against infections with both wild-type and drug-resistant SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV will be defined using cultured cells and mice. The therapeutic effect of treatment combining a DAA with an immunomodulator will be assessed in mouse models of SARS and MERS. These studies will generate mechanistic and efficacy data necessary for IND filing and origination of human clinical trials.",

    "Abstract": "Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) are a significant threat to global health, as demonstrated by the emergence of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Our group identified bats as the wildlife reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and we have now published hundreds of novel SARS-related CoV (SARSr-CoV) sequences. Work under our previous NIH funding, and by others, has demonstrated that bats in Asia harbor an extraordinary diversity of SARSr-CoVs, some of which can use human ACE2 for cell entry, cause SARS-like illness in laboratory animals, and may evade current therapies or vaccines. Our analysis of ecological and human serological data indicates a median of around 66,000 people are infected by bat-SARSr-CoVs in the region each year, with unknown public health impacts. In this modification to our renewed R01, first awarded in 2019, we plan three aims: Aim 1. Analyze more than 300 full genomes/large genome segments of bat SARSr-CoVs from our prior bat sampling in southern China to identify viral characteristics, host biological traits, and environmental/ecological factors that lead to ?recombination hotspots?. We will use host range modeling, complex phylogenetics, and ecological, environmental and demographic data to assess factors that may enhance recombination. We will also analyze spillover risk from over 200 other bat CoV RdRp sequences identified in our prior work to assess the generality of correlates of SARSr-CoV spillover risk for all bat-CoVs; Aim 2. Use our community- and clinic-based survey data and archived pre-COVID-19 human samples to identify putative SARSr-CoV spillover events, routes of exposure, and potential public health consequences. We will test samples with a SARSr-CoV ACE2 surrogate virus neutralization to identify pre-COVID-19 infection with SARSr-CoVs and other ACE2 binding CoVs. We will test archived clinic-based syndromic surveillance samples to assess if patients presenting with influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory illness have PCR or serological evidence of SARSr-CoV infection; Aim 3. Use computer modeling and cell culture to analyze potential binding interactions among novel bat-CoVs, putative reservoir and intermediate hosts, and people, to validate spillover predictions from Aims 1 & 2. Rather than use recombinant virus technology, we will estimate CoV binding to human cells using amino acid sequence analysis, modeling of RBD binding to human, bat & other putative host ACE2 and other receptors, and binding assays with non-infectious viral proteins and pseudovirus technology in vitro. We will then test our hypothesis that SARSr-CoVs with 10-25% spike protein sequence divergence from SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 are able to infect human cells, and evade therapeutics and vaccines. Work from all three aims will help demonstrate proof-of-concept that our bat CoV program is a model platform to integrate analysis of virological and ecological factors contributing to CoV emergence and inform high impact strategies to prevent future pandemics. This includes providing critical reagents, therapeutic interventions, and viral genome sequences for pandemic and public health preparedness to counter future potential coronavirus outbreaks.",
